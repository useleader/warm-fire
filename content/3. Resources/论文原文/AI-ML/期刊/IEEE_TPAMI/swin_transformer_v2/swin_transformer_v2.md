  Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the
  performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also
  demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings.
  This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We
  tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision
  models, including training instability, resolution gaps between
  pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main
  techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with
  cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced
  continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models
  pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with
  high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method,
  SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these
  techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin
  Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date,
  and makes it capable of training with images of up to
  1,536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1,536 resolution. It set new performance
  records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image
  classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation,
  and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training
  is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual
  models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less
  training time. Code is available at

# Introduction {#sec:intro}

Scaling up language models has been incredibly successful. It
significantly improves a model's performance on language
tasks [@devlin2018bert; @radford2019language; @raffel2019t5; @Turing-17B; @fedus2021switch; @Megatron-Turing-530B]
and the model demonstrates amazing few-shot capabilities similar to that
of human beings [@brown2020language]. Since the BERT large model with
340 million parameters [@devlin2018bert], language models are quickly
scaled up by more than 1,000 times in a few years, reaching 530 billion
dense parameters [@Megatron-Turing-530B] and 1.6 trillion sparse
parameters [@fedus2021switch]. These large language models are also
found to possess increasingly strong few-shot capabilities akin to human
intelligence for a broad range of language tasks [@brown2020language].

![To better scale up model capacity and window resolution, several
adaptions are made on the original Swin Transformer architecture
(V1): 1) A *res-post-norm* to replace the previous *pre-norm*
configuration; 2) A *scaled cosine attention* to replace the original
*dot product attention*; 3) A *log-spaced continuous* relative position
bias approach to replace the previous *parameterized* approach.
Adaptions 1) and 2) make it easier for the model to scale up capacity.
Adaption 3) makes the model to be transferred more effectively across
window resolutions. The adapted architecture is named Swin Transformer
V2.](figs/teaserv6.pdf){#fig:teaser width="1.0\\linewidth"}

On the other hand, the scaling up of vision models has been lagging
behind. While it has long been recognized that larger vision models
usually perform better on vision
tasks [@simonyan2014vgg; @he2015resnet], the absolute model size was
just able to reach about 1-2 billion parameters very
recently [@kolesnikov2019bigtransfer; @goyal2021selfsupervised; @zhai2021scaling; @riquelme2021scaling; @dai2021coatnet].
More importantly, unlike large language models, the existing large
vision models are applied to the image classification task
only [@zhai2021scaling; @riquelme2021scaling; @dai2021coatnet].

To successfully train large and general vision model, we need to address
a few key issues. Firstly, our experiments with large vision models
reveal an instability issue in training. We find that the discrepancy of
activation amplitudes across layers becomes significantly greater in
large models. A closer look at the original architecture reveals that
this is caused by the output of the residual unit directly added back to
the main branch. The result is that the activation values are
accumulated layer by layer, and the amplitudes at deeper layers are thus
significantly larger than those at early layers. To address this issue,
we propose a new normalization configuration, called res-post-norm,
which moves the LN layer from the beginning of each residual unit to the
backend, as shown in Figure [1](#fig:teaser){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:teaser"}. We find this new configuration produces much
milder activation values across the network layers. We also propose a
scaled cosine attention to replace the previous dot product attention.
The scaled cosine attention makes the computation irrelevant to
amplitudes of block inputs, and the attention values are less likely to
fall into extremes. In our experiments, the proposed two techniques not
only make the training process more stable but also improve the accuracy
especially for larger models.

Secondly, many downstream vision tasks such as object detection and
semantic segmentation require high resolution input images or large
attention windows. The window size variations between low-resolution
pre-training and high-resolution fine-tuning can be quite large. The
current common practice is to perform a bi-cubic interpolation of the
position bias maps [@dosovitskiy2020vit; @liu2021swin]. This simple fix
is somewhat ad-hoc and the result is usually sub-optimal. We introduce a
log-spaced continuous position bias (Log-CPB), which generates bias
values for arbitrary coordinate ranges by applying a small meta network
on the log-spaced coordinate inputs. Since the meta network takes any
coordinates, a pre-trained model will be able to freely transfer across
window sizes by sharing weights of the meta network. A critical design
of our approach is to transform the coordinates into the log-space so
that the extrapolation ratio can be low even when the target window size
is significantly larger than that of pre-training. The scaling up of
model capacity and resolution also leads to prohibitively high GPU
memory consumption with existing vision models. To resolve the memory
issue, we incorporate several important techniques including
zero-optimizer [@rajbhandari2020zero], activation check
pointing [@chen2016training] and a novel implementation of sequential
self-attention computation. With these techniques, the GPU memory
consumption of large models and resolutions is significantly reduced
with only marginal effect on the training speed.

With the above techniques, we successfully trained a 3 billion Swin
Transformer model and effectively transferred it to various vision tasks
with image resolution as large as 1,536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1,536,
using Nvidia A100-40G GPUs. In our model pre-training, we also employ
self-supervised pre-training to reduce the dependency on super-huge
labeled data. With 40$\times$ less labelled data than that in previous
practice (JFT-3B), the 3 billion model achieves the state-of-the-art
accuracy on a broad range of vision benchmarks. Specifically, it obtains
84.0% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-V2 image classification validation
set [@recht2019imagenet], 63.1 / 54.4 box / mask AP on the COCO test-dev
set of object detection, 59.9 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, and
86.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 video action classification, which
are +NA%, +4.4/+3.3, +6.3 and +1.9 higher than the best numbers in the
original Swin Transformers [@liu2021swin; @liu2021video], and surpass
previous best records by +0.8% ([@zhai2021scaling]),
+1.8/+1.4 ([@xu2021endtoend]), +1.5 ([@bao2021beit]) and +1.4%
([@ryoo2021tokenlearner]).

By scaling up both capacity and resolution of vision models with strong
performance on general vision tasks, just like a good language model's
performance on general NLP tasks, we aim to stimulate more research in
this direction so that we can eventually close the capacity gap between
vision and language models and facilitate the joint modeling of the two
domains.

# Related Works

#### Language networks and scaling up

Transformer has served the standard network since the pioneer work
of [@vaswani2017attention]. The exploration of scaling this architecture
has since begun, and the progress has been accelerated by the invention
of effective self-supervised learning approaches, such as masked or
auto-regressive language
modeling [@devlin2018bert; @radford2019language], and has been further
encouraged by the discovery of a scaling law [@kaplan2020scaling]. Since
then, the capacity of language models has increased dramatically by more
than 1,000 times in a few years, from BERT-340M to the
Megatron-Turing-530B [@raffel2019t5; @Turing-17B; @brown2020language; @Megatron-Turing-530B]
and sparse Switch-Transformer-1.6T [@fedus2021switch]. With increased
capacity, the accuracy of various language benchmarks has been
significantly improved. The zero-shot or few-shot performance is also
significantly improved [@brown2020language], which is a foundation of
human generic intelligence.

#### Vision networks and scaling up

CNNs have long been the standard computer vision
networks [@lecun1998lenet; @krizhevsky2012alexnet]. Since
AlexNet [@krizhevsky2012alexnet], architectures have become deeper and
larger, which has greatly advanced various visual tasks and largely
fueled the wave of deep learning in computer vision, such as
VGG [@simonyan2014vgg], GoogleNet [@szegedy2015googlenet] and
ResNet  citehe2015resnet. In the past two years, the CNN architectures
have been further scaled up to about 1 billion parameters
 [@kolesnikov2019bigtransfer; @goyal2021selfsupervised], however,
absolute performance may not be so encouraging, perhaps due to inductive
biases in the CNN architecture limiting modeling power.

Last year, Transformers started taking over one representative visual
benchmark after another, including ImageNet-1K image-level
classification benchmarks [@dosovitskiy2020vit], COCO region-level
object detection benchmark [@liu2021swin], ADE20K pixel-level semantic
segmentation benchmark [@zheng2020SETR; @liu2021swin], Kinetics-400
video action classification benchmark [@arnab2021vivit], etc. Since
these works, numerous vision Transformer variants have been proposed to
improve the accuracy at relatively small
scale [@touvron2020deit; @li2021localvit; @chu2021twins; @wang2021pyramid; @yuan2021tokenstotoken; @zhang2021multiscale; @dong2021cswin; @yang2021focal; @huang2021shuffle; @xiao2021early; @yuan2021volo].
Only a few works have attempted to scale up the vision
Transformers [@zhai2021scaling; @riquelme2021scaling; @dai2021coatnet].
However, they rely on a huge image dataset with classification labels,
i.e., JFT-3B, and are only applied to image classification problems.

#### Transferring across window / kernel resolution

For CNNs, previous works typically fixed kernel size during pre-training
and fine-tuning. Global vision Transformers, such as
ViT [@dosovitskiy2020vit], compute attention globally, with the
equivalent attention window size linearly proportional to the increased
input image resolution. For local vision Transformer architectures, such
as Swin Transformer [@liu2021swin], the window size can be either fixed
or changed during fine-tuning. Allowing variable window sizes is more
convenient in use, so as to be divisible by the probably variable entire
feature map and to tune receptive fields for better accuracy. To handle
the variable window sizes between pre-training and fine-tuning, bi-cubic
interpolation was the previous common
practice [@dosovitskiy2020vit; @liu2021swin]. In this paper, we propose
a log-spaced continuous position bias approach (Log-CPB) that more
smoothly transfers pre-trained model weights at low resolution to
deal-with higher resolution windows.

#### Study on bias terms

In NLP, the relative position bias method proved
beneficial [@raffel2019t5], compared to the absolute position embedding
used in the original Transformer [@vaswani2017attention]. In computer
vision, the relative positional bias method is more commonly
used [@hu2019localrelation; @liu2021swin; @yang2021focal], probably
because the spatial relationships of visual signals play a more
important role in visual modeling. A common practice is to directly
learn the bias values as model weights. There are also a few works
particularly study how to set and learn the bias
terms [@ke2021rethinking; @wu2021rethinking].

#### Continuous convolution and variants

Our Log-CPB approach is also related to earlier works on continuous
convolution and variants
 [@schutt2017schnet; @wang2018continuousconvcvpr; @hu2018relation; @liu2020closer],
which utilize a meta network to handle irregular data points. Our
Log-CPB approach is inspired by these efforts while solving a different
problem of transferring relative position biases in vision Transformers
across arbitrary window sizes. We also propose log-spaced coordinates to
alleviate the difficulty of extrapolation when transferring between
large size changes.

# Swin Transformer V2

## A Brief Review of Swin Transformer {#sec.swin_v1}

Swin Transformer is a general-purpose computer vision backbone that has
achieved strong performance in various granular recognition tasks such
as region-level object detection, pixel-level semantic segmentation, and
image-level image classification. The main idea of Swin Transformer is
to introduce several important visual priors into the vanilla
Transformer encoder, including hierarchy, locality, and translation
invariance, which combines the strength of both: the basic Transformer
unit has strong modeling capabilities, and the visual priors make it
friendly to a variety of visual tasks.

#### Normalization configuration

It is widely known that normalization
technologies [@ioffe2015batch; @ba2016layer; @wu2018group; @ulyanov2017instance]
are crucial in stably training deeper architectures. The original Swin
Transformer inherits the common practice in the language
Transformers [@radford2019language] and vanilla
ViT [@dosovitskiy2020vit] to utilize a pre-normalization configuration
without extensive study, as shown in the
figure [1](#fig:teaser){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:teaser"}. In
the following subsections, we will examine this default normalization
configuration[^2].

#### Relative position bias

is a key component in the original Swin Transformer which introduces an
additional parametric bias term to encode the geometric relationship in
self-attention calculation: $$\label{eq.att}
    \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{SoftMax}(QK^T/\sqrt{d}+B)V,$$
where $B \in \mathbb{R}^{M^2 \times M^2}$ is the relative position bias
term for each head; $Q, K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{M^2\times d}$ are the
*query*, *key* and *value* matrices; $d$ is the *query*/*key* dimension,
and $M^2$ is the number of patches in a window. The relative position
bias encodes relative spatial configurations of visual elements and is
shown critical in a variety of visual tasks, especially for dense
recognition tasks such as object detection.

In Swin Transformer, the relative positions along each axis are within
the range of $[-M+1, M-1]$ and the relative position bias is
parameterized as a bias matrix
$\hat{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{(2M-1)\times (2M-1)}$, and the elements in $B$
are taken from $\hat{B}$. When transferring across different window
sizes, the learnt relative position bias matrix in pre-training is used
to initialize the bias matrix of a different size in fine-tuning by
bi-cubic interpolation.

#### Issues in scaling up model capacity and window resolution

We observe two issues when we scale up the capacity and window
resolution of the Swin Transformer.

-   *An instability issue when scaling up model capacity*. As shown in
    Figure [2](#fig:act){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:act"}, when
    we scale up the original Swin Transformer model from small size to
    large size, the activation values at deeper layers increase
    dramatically. The discrepancy between layers with the highest and
    the lowest amplitudes has reached an extreme value of $10^4$. When
    we scale it up further to a huge size (658 million parameters), it
    cannot complete the training, as shown in
    Figure [3](#fig:divergence_of_huge_v1){reference-type="ref"
    reference="fig:divergence_of_huge_v1"}.

-   *Degraded performance when transferring models across window
    resolutions*. As shown in the first row of
    Table [\[tab:lcpb\]](#tab:lcpb){reference-type="ref"
    reference="tab:lcpb"}, the accuracy decreases significantly when we
    directly test the accuracy of a pre-trained ImageNet-1K model
    ($256\times 256$ images with $8\times 8$ window size) at larger
    image resolutions and window sizes through the bi-cubic
    interpolation approach. It may be worth re-examining the relative
    position bias approach in the original Swin Transformer.

crashes.](figs/act5.pdf){#fig:act width="0.95\\linewidth"}

In the following subsections, we present techniques to address these
issues, including *residual post normalization* and *scaled cosine
attention* to address the instability issue, and a *log-spaced
continuous position bias* approach to address the issue in transferring
across window resolutions.

## Scaling Up Model Capacity

As mentioned in Section [3.1](#sec.swin_v1){reference-type="ref"
reference="sec.swin_v1"}, the original Swin Transformer (and most vision
Transformers) adopts a layer norm layer at the beginning of each block,
inherited from vanilla ViT. When we scale up the model capacity, a
significant increase in activation values is observed at deeper layers.
In fact, in a pre-normalization configuration, the output activation
values of each residual block are merged directly back to the main
branch, and the amplitude of the main branch grows larger and larger at
deeper layers. Large amplitude discrepancy in different layers causes
training instability.

#### Post normalization

To ease this problem, we propose to use a *residual post normalization*
approach instead, as shown in
Figure [1](#fig:teaser){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:teaser"}. In
this approach, the output of each residual block is normalized before
merging back into the main branch, and the amplitude of the main branch
does not accumulate when the layer goes deeper. As shown in
Figure [2](#fig:act){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:act"}, the
activation amplitudes by this approach are much milder than in the
original pre-normalization configuration.

In our largest model training, we introduce an additional layer
normalization layer on the main branch every 6 Transformer blocks, to
further stabilize training.

#### Scaled cosine attention

In the original self-attention computation, the similarity terms of the
pixel pairs are computed as a dot product of the *query* and *key*
vectors. We find that when this approach is used in large visual models,
the learnt attention maps of some blocks and heads are frequently
dominated by a few pixel pairs, especially in the *res-post-norm*
configuration. To ease this issue, we propose a *scaled cosine
attention* approach that computes the attention logit of a pixel pair
$i$ and $j$ by a scaled cosine function: $$\label{eq.att}
    \text{Sim}(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{k}_j) = \text{cos}(\mathbf{q}_i, \mathbf{k}_j) / \tau + B_{ij},$$
where $B_{ij}$ is the relative position bias between pixel $i$ and $j$;
$\tau$ is a learnable scalar, non-shared across heads and layers. $\tau$
is set larger than 0.01. The cosine function is naturally normalized,
and thus can have milder attention values.

![SwinV1-H versus SwinV2-H in
training [@simmim].](figs/h_loss2.pdf){#fig:divergence_of_huge_v1
width="1.0\\linewidth"}

## Scaling Up Window Resolution

In this subsection, we introduce a log-spaced continuous position bias
approach, so that the relative position bias can be smoothly transferred
across window resolutions.

#### Continuous relative position bias

Instead of directly optimizing the parameterized biases, the
*continuous* position bias approach adopts a small meta network on the
relative coordinates: $$\label{eq.cpb}
    B (\Delta x, \Delta y) = \mathcal{G} (\Delta x, \Delta y),$$ where
$\mathcal{G}$ is a small network, e.g., a 2-layer MLP with a ReLU
activation in between by default.

The meta network $\mathcal{G}$ generates bias values for arbitrary
relative coordinates, and thus can be naturally transferred to
fine-tuning tasks with arbitrarily varying window sizes. In inference,
the bias values at each relative position can be pre-computed and stored
as model parameters, such that the inference is the same as the original
parameterized bias approach.

#### Log-spaced coordinates

When transferring across largely varying window sizes, a large portion
of the relative coordinate range needs to be extrapolated. To ease this
issue, we propose using log-spaced coordinates instead of the original
linear-spaced ones: $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq.log_coord}
    \widehat{\Delta x} = \text{sign}(x) \cdot \log(1+|\Delta x|), \\
    \widehat{\Delta y} = \text{sign}(y) \cdot \log(1+|\Delta y|),
\end{aligned}$$ where $\Delta x$, $\Delta y$ and $\widehat{\Delta x}$,
$\widehat{\Delta y}$ are the linear-scaled and log-spaced coordinates,
respectively.

By using the log-spaced coordinates, when we transfer the relative
position biases across window resolutions, the required extrapolation
ratio will be much smaller than that of using the original linear-spaced
coordinates. For an example of transferring from a pre-trained
$8\times 8$ window size to a fine-tuned $16\times 16$ window size, using
the original raw coordinates, the input coordinate range will be from
$[-7, 7]\times [-7, 7]$ to $[-15, 15]\times [-15, 15]$. The
extrapolation ratio is $\frac{8}{7}=1.14\times$ of the original range.
Using log-spaced coordinates, the input range will be from
$[-2.079, 2.079]\times [-2.079, 2.079]$ to
$[-2.773, 2.773]\times [-2.773, 2.773]$. The extrapolation ratio is
$0.33\times$ of the original range, which is an about 4 times smaller
extrapolation ratio than that using the original linear-spaced
coordinates.

Table [\[tab:lcpb\]](#tab:lcpb){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:lcpb"} compares the transferring performance of different
position bias computation approaches. It can be seen that the log-spaced
CPB (continuous position bias) approach performs best, particularly when
transferred to larger window sizes.

## Self-Supervised Pre-training

Larger models are more data hungry. To address the data hungry problem,
previous large vision models typically utilize huge labelled data such
as JFT-3B [@zhai2021scaling; @riquelme2021scaling; @dai2021coatnet]. In
this work, we exploit a self-supervised pre-training method,
SimMIM [@simmim], to alleviate the demands on labelled data. By this
approach, we successfully trained a powerful Swin Transformer model of 3
billion parameters which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) on 4
representative visual benchmarks, by using only 70 million labelled
images (1/40 of that in JFT-3B).

## Implementation to Save GPU Memory

Another issue lies in the unaffordable GPU memory consumption with a
regular implementation when both the capacity and resolution are large.
To facility the memory issue, we adopt the following implementations:

-   *Zero-Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)* [@rajbhandari2020zero]. In a
    general data-parallel implementation of optimizers, the model
    parameters and optimization states are broadcasted to every GPU.
    This implementation is very unfriendly on GPU memory consumption,
    for example, a model of 3 billion parameters will consume 48G GPU
    memory when an AdamW optimizer and fp32 weights/states are used.
    With a ZeRO optimizer, the model parameters and the corresponding
    optimization states will be split and distributed to multiple GPUs,
    which significantly reduces memory consumption. We adopt the
    DeepSpeed framework and use the ZeRO stage-1 option in our
    experiments. This optimization has little effect on training speed.

-   *Activation check-pointing* [@chen2016training]. Feature maps in the
    Transformer layers also consume a lot of GPU memory, which can
    create bottlenecks when image and window resolutions are high. The
    activation check-pointing technology can significantly reduce the
    memory consumption, while the training speed is up to 30% slower.

-   *Sequential self-attention computation*. To train large models on
    very large resolutions, for example, an image of
    1,536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1,536 resolution with a window size of
    32$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}32, regular A100 GPUs (40GB memory) are
    still unaffordable, even with the above two optimization
    technologies. We found that in this case, the self-attention module
    constitutes a bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, we implement
    self-attention computation sequentially, instead of using the
    previous batch computation approach. This optimization is applied to
    the layers in the first two stages and has little impact on the
    overall training speed.

With these implementations, we managed to train a 3B model using the
Nvidia A100-40G GPUs for COCO object detection with an input image
resolution of 1,536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1,536, and Kinetics-400
action classification with an input resolution of
$320\times 320 \times 8$.

## Model configurations

We maintain the stage, block, and channel settings of the original Swin
Transformer for 4 configurations of Swin Transformer V2:

-   SwinV2-T: $C$ = $96$, #. block = $\{2, 2, 6, 2\}$

-   SwinV2-S/B/L: $C$=$96/128/192$, #.block=$\{2, 2, 18, 2\}$

with $C$ the number of channels in the first stage.

We further scale up Swin Transformer V2 to its huge size and giant size,
with 658 million parameters and 3 billion parameters, respectively:

-   SwinV2-H: $C=352$, #. block = $\{2, 2, 18, 2\}$

-   SwinV2-G: $C=512$, #. block = $\{2, 2, 42, 4\}$

For SwinV2-H and SwinV2-G, we add an additional layer normalization
layer on the main branch every 6 layers. To save experimental time, we
only employ SwinV2-G for large-scale experiments. SwinV2-H is employed
for another parallel study about self-supervised learning [@simmim].

# Experiments

## Tasks and Datasets

We conduct experiments on ImageNet-1K image classification (V1 and
V2) [@deng2009imagenet; @recht2019imagenet], COCO object
detection [@lin2014coco], and ADE20K semantic
segmentation [@zhou2018semantic]. For the 3B model experiments, we also
report the accuracy on Kinetics-400 video action
recognition [@kay2017kinetics].

-   *Image classification*. ImageNet-1K V1 and V2 val are
    used [@deng2009imagenet; @recht2019imagenet] for evaluation.
    ImageNet-22K [@deng2009imagenet] which has 14M images and 22K
    categories is optionally employed for pre-training. For the
    pre-training our largest model SwinV2-G, a privately collected
    ImageNet-22K-ext dataset with 70 million images is used. For this
    dataset, a duplicate removal process [@radford2021clip] is conducted
    to exclude overlapping images with ImageNet-1K V1 and V2 validation
    sets.

-   *Object detection*. COCO [@lin2014coco] is used for evaluation. For
    our largest model experiments, we employ an additional detection
    pre-training phase using Object 365 v2 dataset [@Shao_2019_ICCV],
    in-between the image classification pre-training phase and the COCO
    fine-tuning phase.

-   *Semantic segmentation*. ADE20K [@zhou2018semantic] is used.

-   *Video action classification*. Kinetics-400
    (K400) [@kay2017kinetics] is used in evaluation.

The pre-training and fine-tuning settings will be detailed in Appendix.

## Scaling Up Experiments

We first present the results on various representative visual benchmarks
by scaling up models to 3 billion parameters and to high image/window
resolutions.

#### Settings for SwinV2-G experiments

We adopt a smaller $192\times 192$ image resolution in pre-training to
save on training costs. We take a 2-step pre-training approach. First,
the model is pre-trained using a self-supervised method [@simmim] on the
ImageNet-22K-ext dataset by 20 epochs. Second, the model is further
pre-trained by 30 epochs using the image classification task on this
dataset. Detailed pre-training and fine-tuning setups are described in
the appendix.

In the following paragraphs, we report the accuracy of SwinV2-G on
representative vision benchmarks. Note that since our main goal is to
explore how to feasibly scale up model capacity and window resolution,
and whether the vision tasks can benefit from significantly larger
capacity, we did not particularly align complexities or pre-training
data in comparisons.

#### ImageNet-1K image classification results

Table [\[tab:sota_imagenet\]](#tab:sota_imagenet){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:sota_imagenet"} compares the SwinV2-G model with
previously largest/best vision models on ImageNet-1K V1 and V2
classification. SwinV2-G is the largest dense vision model to present.
It achieves a top-1 accuracy of 84.0% on the ImageNet V2 benchmark,
which is +0.7% higher than previous best one (83.3%). Our accuracy on
ImageNet-1K V1 is marginally lower (90.17% vs 90.88%). The performance
difference might come from different degrees of dataset
over-tuning [@recht2019imagenet]. Also note we employ much less training
iterations and lower image resolutions than those in previous efforts,
while performing very well.

We also compare the SwinV2-B and SwinV2-L to the original SwinV1-B and
SwinV1-L, respectively, where a +0.8% and +0.4% gains are observed. The
shrunken gains by SwinV2-L than that of SwinV2-B may imply that if
exceeding this size, more labeled data, stronger regularization, or
advanced self-supervised learning methods are required.

#### COCO object detection results

Table [\[tab:sota_coco\]](#tab:sota_coco){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:sota_coco"} compares the SwinV2-G model with previous
best results on COCO object detection and instance segmentation. It
achieves 63.1/54.4 box/max AP on COCO test-dev, which is +1.8/1.4 higher
than previous best numberw (61.3/53.0 by [@xu2021endtoend]). This
suggests that scaling up vision model is beneficial for the dense vision
recognition task of object detection. Our approach can use a different
window size at test to additionally benefit, probably attributed to the
effective Log-spaced CPB approach.

#### ADE20K semantic segmentation results

Table [\[tab:sota_ade\]](#tab:sota_ade){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:sota_ade"} compares the SwinV2-G model with previous best
results on the ADE20K semantic segmentation benchmark. It achieves 59.9
mIoU on ADE20K val set, +1.5 higher than the previous best number (58.4
by [@bao2021beit]). This suggests scaling up vision model is beneficial
for pixel-level vision recognition tasks. Using a larger window size at
test time can additionally bring +0.2 gains, probably attributed to the
effective Log-spaced CPB approach.

#### Kinetics-400 video action classification results

Table [1](#tab:sota_kinetics){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:sota_kinetics"} compares the SwinV2-G model with previous
best results on the Kinetics-400 action classification benchmark. It
achieves 86.8% top-1 accuracy, +1.4% higher than previous best
number [@ryoo2021tokenlearner]. This suggests that scaling up vision
models also benefits video recognition tasks. In this scenario, using a
larger window size at test time can also bring additional benefits of
+0.2%, probably attributed to the effective Log-spaced CPB approach.

## Ablation Study

#### Ablation on res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention

Table [2](#tab:postnorm_cosatt){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:postnorm_cosatt"} ablates the performance of applying the
proposed res-post-norm and scaled cosine attention approaches to Swin
Transformer. Both techniques improve the accuracy at all the tiny, small
and base size, and the overall improvements are +0.2%, +0.4% and +0.5%
respectively, indicating the techniques are more beneficial for larger
models. It also turns out to benefit ViT architecture (+0.4%). The
proposed normalization approach also performs better than some other
normalization methods, as shown in
Table [3](#tab:norm){reference-type="ref" reference="tab:norm"}.

More importantly, the combination of post-norm and scaled cosine
attention stabilize the training. As shown in
Figure [2](#fig:act){reference-type="ref" reference="fig:act"}, while
the activation values at deeper layers for the original Swin Transformer
are almost exploded at large (L) size, those of the new version have
much milder behavior. On a huge size model, the self-supervised
pre-training [@simmim] diverges using the original Swin Transformer,
while it trains well by a Swin Transformer V2 model.

#### Scaling up window resolution by different approaches

Table [\[tab:lcpb\]](#tab:lcpb){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:lcpb"} and [4](#tab:ablate_cpb_size){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:ablate_cpb_size"} ablate the performance of 3 approaches
by scaling window resolutions from $256\times 256$ in pre-training to
larger sizes in 3 down-stream vision tasks of ImageNet-1K image
classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20K semantic segmentation,
respectively. It can be seen that: 1) Different approaches have similar
accuracy in pre-training (81.7%-81.8%); 2) When transferred to
down-stream tasks, the two continuous position bias (CPB) approaches
perform consistently better than the parameterized position bias
approach used in Swin Transformer V1. Compared to the linear-spaced
approach, the log-spaced version is marginally better; 3) The larger the
change in resolutions between pre-training and fine-tuning, the larger
the benefit of the proposed log-spaced CPB approach.

In Table [\[tab:lcpb\]](#tab:lcpb){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:lcpb"} and [4](#tab:ablate_cpb_size){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:ablate_cpb_size"}, we also report the accuracy using
targeted window resolutions without fine-tuning (see the first number in
each column in the ImageNet-1K experiments). The recognition accuracy
remains not bad even when the window size is enlarged from $8$ to $24$
(78.9% versus 81.8%), while the top-1 accuracy of the original approach
significantly degrades from 81.7% to 68.7%. Also note that without
fine-tuning, using a window size of $12$ that the pre-trained model has
never seen before can even be +0.4% higher that the original accuracy.
This suggests that we can improve accuracy through test-time window
adjustment, as also observed in
Table [\[tab:sota_coco\]](#tab:sota_coco){reference-type="ref"
reference="tab:sota_coco"},
[\[tab:sota_ade\]](#tab:sota_ade){reference-type="ref"

# Conclusion

We have presented techniques for scaling Swin Transformer up to 3
billion parameters and making it capable of training with images of up
to 1,536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1,536 resolution, including the
*res-post-norm* and *scaled cosine attention* to make the model easier
to be scaled up in capacity, as well a log-spaced continuous relative
position bias approach which lets the model more effectively transferred
across window resolutions. The adapted architecture is named Swin
Transformer V2, and by scaling up capacity and resolution, it sets new
records on 4 representative vision benchmarks. By these strong results,
we hope to stimulate more research in this direction so that we can
eventually close the capacity gap between vision and language models and
facilitate the joint modeling of the two domains.

# Experimental Settings for Ablation

This section describes the experimental settings for ablation, including
models of SwinV2-T, SwinV2-S, and SwinV2-B, and tasks of ImageNet-1K
image classification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic
segmentation.

## ImageNet-1K Pre-training

All ablation study use the ImageNet-1K image classification task for
pre-training. We adopt an input image size (window size) of
256$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}256 (8$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}8)[^3].
Following [@liu2021swin], we employ an AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled]
optimizer for 300 epochs using a cosine decay learning rate scheduler
with 20 epochs of linear warm-up. A batch size of 1024, an initial
learning rate of $1\times10^{-3}$, a weight decay of 0.05, and gradient
clipping with a max norm of 5.0 are used. Augmentation and
regularization strategies include RandAugment [@cubuk2020randaugment],
Mixup [@zhang2017mixup], Cutmix [@yun2019cutmix], random
erasing [@zhong2020random] and stochastic depth [@huang2016deep]. An
increasing degree of stochastic depth augmentation is employed for
larger models, i.e. $0.2, 0.3, 0.5$ for tiny, small, and base models,
respectively.

## Fine-tuning on various tasks

#### ImageNet-1K image classification

For ImageNet-1K image classification experiments, we conduct a
fine-tuning step if the input image resolution is larger than that in
the pre-training step. The fine-tuning lasts for 30 epochs, with an
AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer, a cosine decay learning rate
scheduler with an initial learning rate of $4\times10^{-5}$, a weight
decay of $1\times10^{-8}$, and the same data augmentation and
regularizations as those in the first stage.

#### COCO object detection

We use cascade mask R-CNN [@he2017mask; @cai2018cascade] implemented in
mmdetection [@chen2019mmdetection] as the object detection framework. In
training, a multi-scale
augmentation [@carion2020detr; @sun2020sparsercnn] with the shorter side
between 480 and 800 and the longer side of 1333 is used. The window size
is set 16$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}16. An
AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer with an initial learning rate
of $1\times10^{-4}$, a weight decay of 0.05, a batch size of 16, and a
3$\times$ scheduler are used.

#### ADE20K semantic segmentation

We adopt an image size (window size) of 512$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}512
(16$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}16). In training, we employ an
AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer with an initial learning rate
of $4\times10^{-5}$, a weight decay of 0.05, a learning rate scheduler
that uses linear learning rate decay and a linear warm-up of 1,500
iterations. Models are trained with batch size of 16 for 160K
iterations. We follow the mmsegmentation codebase to adopt augmentations
of random horizontal flipping, random re-scaling within ratio range
\[0.5, 2.0\] and a random photometric distortion. Stochastic depth with
ratio of $0.3$ is applied for all models. A layer-wise learning rate
decay [@bao2021beit] of 0.95 is adopted for all experiments.

# Experimental Settings for System-Level Comparison

## SwinV2-B and SwinV2-L Settings

Table 2, 3 and 4 include results of SwinV2-B and SwinV2-L. For these
experiments, we first conduct ImageNet-22K pre-training, and then
fine-tune the pre-trained models on individual down-stream recognition
tasks.

#### ImageNet-22K pre-training

Both models use an input image size (window size) of
192$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}192 (12$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}12). We
employ an AdamW optimizer [@loshchilov2017decoupled] for 90 epochs using
a cosine learning rate scheduler with 5-epoch linear warm-up. A batch
size of 4096, an initial learning rate of 0.001, a weight decay of 0.1,
and gradient clipping with a max norm of 5.0 are used. Augmentation and
regularization strategies include RandAugment [@cubuk2020randaugment],
Mixup [@zhang2017mixup], Cutmix [@yun2019cutmix], random
erasing [@zhong2020random] and stochastic depth [@huang2016deep] with
ratio of 0.2.

#### ImageNet-1K image classification

We consider input image sizes of 256$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}256 and
384$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}384. The training length is set 30 epochs,
with a batch size of 1024, a cosine decay learning rate scheduler with
an initial learning rate of $4\times10^{-5}$, and a weight decay of
$1\times10^{-8}$. The ImageNet-1K classification weights are also
initialized from the corresponding ones in the ImageNet-22K model.

#### COCO object detection

We adopt HTC++ [@chen2019htc; @liu2021swin] for experiments. In data
pre-processing, Instaboost [@fang2019instaboost], a multi-scale
training [@ghiasi2019fpn] with an input image size of
1536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1536, a window size of
32$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}32, and a random scale between $[0.1, 2.0]$
are used. An AdamW optimizer [@loshchilov2017decoupled] with an initial
learning rate of $4\times10^{-4}$ on batch size of 64, a weight decay of
0.05, and a $3\times$ scheduler are used. The backbone learning rate is
set $0.1\times$ of the head learning rate. In inference,
soft-NMS [@Bodla2017softnms] is used. Both single-scale and multi-scale
test results are reported.

#### ADE20K semantic segmentation

The input image size (window size) is set
640$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}640 (40$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}40). We
employ an AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer with an initial
learning rate of $6\times10^{-5}$, a weight decay of 0.05, a linear
decayed learning rate scheduler with 375-iteration linear warm-up. The
model is trained with batch size of 64 for 40K iterations. We follow the
default settings in mmsegmentation for data augmentation, including
random horizontal flipping, random re-scaling within ratio range
$[0.5, 2.0]$ and random photometric distortion. Stochastic depth with
ratio of $0.3$ is applied.

## SwinV2-G Settings

#### Stage-1 self-supervised pre-training

The model is first pre-trained using a self-supervised learning
approach [@anonymous] on the ImageNet-22K-ext dataset (70 million
images) for 20 epochs. To reduce experimental overheads, we adopt a
smaller image size of 192$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}192. The model is
trained using the AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer with a
cosine decay learning rate scheduler with 30000 steps of linear warm-up.
A batch size of 9216, an initial learning rate of $1.4\times10^{-3}$, a
weight decay of 0.1, and gradient clipping with a max norm of 100.0 are
used. A light data augmentation strategy is employed: random resize
cropping with scale range of \[0.67, 1\] and a aspect ratio range of
\[3/4, 4/3\], followed by a random flipping and a color normalization
steps.

#### Stage-2 supervised pre-training

The model is further pre-trained using the class labels on the
ImageNet-22K-ext dataset. We employ an AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled]
optimizer for 30 epochs, using a cosine decayed learning rate scheduler
with 20000 steps of linear warm-up. A batch size of 9216, an initial
learning rate of $1.4\times10^{-3}$, a layer-wise learning rate decay of
0.87, a weight decay of 0.1, and gradient clipping with a max norm of
100.0 are used. Augmentation and regularization strategies include
RandAugment [@cubuk2020randaugment], random erasing [@zhong2020random]
and a stochastic depth [@huang2016deep] ratio of 0.3.

#### Fine-tuning on ImageNet-1K image classification

We adopt an input image size of 640$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}640 for
experiments. An AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer is employed
for 10 epochs, using a cosine decayed learning rate scheduler and a
2-epoch linear warm-up. A batch size of 576, an initial learning rate of
$2.1\times10^{-5}$, a weight decay of 0.1, and gradient clipping with a
max norm of 100.0 are used. Augmentation and regularization strategies
include RandAugment [@cubuk2020randaugment], random
erasing [@zhong2020random] and a stochastic depth [@huang2016deep] ratio
of 0.5.

In evaluation, we test top-1 accuracy on both ImageNet-1K V1 and V2.

#### Fine-tuning on COCO object detection

We first conduct inter-mediate fine-tuning using the Objects-365 V2
dataset. In this stage, we remove the mask branch of the HTC++
framework [@chen2019htc; @liu2021swin] because there are no mask
annotations. The input image resolution and window size are set as
$[800, 1024]$ and $32\times 32$, respectively. In training, an
AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled] optimizer with initial learning rate of
$1.2\times10^{-3}$, a weight decay of 0.05 and a batch size of 96 are
used, and the training length is set 67,500 steps.

Then we fine-tune the HTC++ model on COCO dataset, with the mask branch
randomly initialized and other model weights loaded from the
Objects-365-V2 pre-trained model. In this training stage, the input
image resolution is set 1536$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}1536 with a
multi-scale ratio of $[0.1, 2.0]$. The window size is set
32$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}32. The AdamW [@loshchilov2017decoupled]
optimizer is employed, with an initial learning rate of
$6\times10^{-4}$, a weight decay of 0.05, and a batch size of 96, and is
trained 45,000 steps.

In test, Soft-NMS [@Bodla2017softnms] is used. Both window sizes of
$32\times32$ and $48\times 48$ are considered.

#### Fine-tuning on ADE20K semantic segmentation

The input image size (window size) is set
640$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}640 (40$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}40). An
AdamW optimizer [@loshchilov2017decoupled] is employed, with an initial
learning rate of $4\times10^{-5}$, a weight decay of 0.05, a linear
decayed learning rate scheduler with 80K iterations, a batch size of 32,
and a linear warm-up of 750 iterations. For augmentations, we follow the
default settings in mmsegmentation to include random horizontal
flipping, random re-scaling within ratio range $[0.5, 2.0]$ and random
photometric distortion. The stochastic depth ratio is set $0.4$.

#### Fine-tuning on Kinetics-400 video action recognition

A 2-stage fine-tuning process is employed. In the first stage, an input
resolution of 256$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}256$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}8
with 16$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}16$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}8 window size
is adopted. We employ the AdamW optimizer for 20 epochs using a cosine
decayed learning rate scheduler with 2.5-epoch linear warm-up. Other
training hyper-parameters are: batch-size 80, an initial learning rate
of $3.6\times10^{-4}$, and a weight decay of 0.1.

In the second stage, we further fine-tune the model using a larger input
video resolution of
320$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}320$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}8 with
20$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}20$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}8 window size. We
employ the AdamW optimizer for 5 epochs using a cosine decayed learning
rate scheduler with 1-epoch linear warm-up. A batch-size of 64, an
initial learning rate of $5\times10^{-5}$ and a weight decay of 0.1 are
set.

# Learnt Relative Position Bias by Different Approaches

Figure [\[fig:rpe_s0b0\]](#fig:rpe_s0b0){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:rpe_s0b0"} visualizes the relative position bias matrices
($\hat{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{(2M-1)\times (2M-1)}$) learnt by different
bias computation approaches, using a SwinV2-T model. The bias matrices
of the 3 heads in the first block are visualized. The left shows the
bias matrices learnt by using an input image size of
256$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}256 and a window size of $8\times 8$. The
right shows the bias matrices after fine-tuning on a larger input image
resolution of 512$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}512 and a larger window size
of 16$\times$`<!-- -->`{=html}16. It turns out that the bias matrices
learnt by two CPB(continuous position bias) approaches are more smoothly
than that learnt by P-RPE (parameterized relative position bias).
Figure [\[fig:rpe_s3b0\]](#fig:rpe_s3b0){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:rpe_s3b0"} shows more examples using the last block of
this model.

[^2]: There have been a few alternative normalization configurations,
    such as post-normalization [@vaswani2017attention] and sandwich
    normalization [@ding2021cogview]. Post-normalization harms training
    stability [@xiongLN2020], and sandwich normalization sacrifices
    representation power due to too many normalization layers.

[^3]: Most of our experiments have the window size as an even number to
    make the window shifting offset divisible by the window size.
    Nevertheless, an odd number of window size also works well, as is
    right the case in the original Swin Transformer ($7\times 7$).
