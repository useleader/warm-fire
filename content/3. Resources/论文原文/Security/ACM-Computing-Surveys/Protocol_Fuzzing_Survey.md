Communication protocols form the bedrock of our interconnected world, yet vulnerabilities within their
implementations pose significant security threats. Recent developments have seen a surge in fuzzing-based
research dedicated to uncovering these vulnerabilities within protocol implementations. However, there
still lacks a systematic overview of protocol fuzzing for answering the essential questions such as what the
unique challenges are, how existing works solve them, etc. To bridge this gap, we conducted a comprehensive
investigation of related works from both academia and industry. Our study includes a detailed summary of
the specific challenges in protocol fuzzing and provides a systematic categorization and overview of existing
research efforts. Furthermore, we explore and discuss potential future research directions in protocol fuzzing.

1 Introduction
Communication protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) [16], TLS (Transport Layer
Security) [40], Bluetooth [150], etc., serve as the cornerstone of communication by defining the rules
for message exchange between parties. As these protocols underpin publicly accessible services,
their security is paramount, and the vulnerabilities contained can lead to severe consequences.
A stark illustration of this is the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL, an implementation of the
TLS protocol. Upon its disclosure, Heartbleed was found to affect over 17% of servers worldwide
[109, 126, 166], demonstrating the extensive impact that a single vulnerability can have. Moreover,
recent statistical analyzes signal an upward trend in high-risk software vulnerabilities within
network services [62], underscoring the increasing risks to network security. Given this context, the
development of automated methods to detect vulnerabilities in network protocol implementations
is not just beneficial but essential for the safeguarding of modern network services.

Fuzzing, as a software testing technique, was brought to the forefront by an empirical study
conducted by Miller et al. in 1990 [107]. This method involves the generation of a large number
of random mutated testcases aimed at triggering abnormal runtime behaviors within a software
program. Due to its simplicity and scalability, fuzzing has proven to be highly effective in uncovering
a wide variety of bugs, leading to its widespread adoption [83, 97, 190, 191, 196, 198]. However,
fuzzing protocol implementations, as opposed to general software such as command-line tools [100,
124, 171], introduces additional challenges. These complexities are largely due to the peculiarities
associated with effectively testing the intricate communication logic that protocols entail, ranging
from methodological considerations to tool-specific requirements. In response to these challenges,
there is a notable trend toward the creation of advanced fuzzing methods explicitly tailored for
protocol testing [15, 18, 39, 53, 55, 90, 104, 123, 153]. Despite this progress, there still remains a
significant gap in research dedicated to systematically examining the distinctive challenges inherent
to this field, thoroughly summarizing the existing solutions and discussing future directions. To fill
this gap, we extensively discuss and analyze protocol fuzzing specifics in the following content of
this article.

1.1 Motivation
The main motivations for this survey are as follows:

• Protocols are the essential rules that dictate how our devices and applications communicate,
making them both ubiquitous and critically important. Because these protocols are every-
where, it is of the utmost importance to ensure they are secure against potential threats.
Fuzzing plays a key role in finding and fixing security issues within these systems. In light
of this, building the first end-to-end guide covering the overview and specifics of protocol
fuzzing is highly valuable for both researchers and those in the tech industry.

• Protocol fuzzing presents unique challenges that set it apart from general application fuzzing,
grounded in the intricacies of the communication protocols themselves. Firstly, there is the
need to adhere to strict rules that dictate not just the structure of the messages but also the
strict sequence and context in which these messages are sent and received [1, 40, 134]. This
makes the testing process complex as it requires an in-depth understanding of how these
communication protocols operate and change over time. Secondly, protocols are built to
address various attributes beyond simple message exchange. They must account for factors
such as timing and how multiple messages or actions can occur simultaneously, which
introduces more variables into the mix when testing for security issues [68, 73, 76]. Third,
the widespread use of protocols across different technology levels and systems adds another
layer of complexity. They are embedded everywhere, from hardware to software applications

that we interact with daily, leading to various testing scenarios and discovering potential
vulnerabilities at every layer [45, 53, 55, 56, 92, 138, 177]. Given these realities, it becomes
imperative to establish a comprehensive understanding of protocol-specific challenges.
• Many protocol fuzzing works have been completed, but so far no systematic review on pro-
tocol fuzzing has been conducted. Although some survey articles [83, 97, 198] on traditional
software fuzzing are available, they cannot provide a systematic overview of the current state
and future directions based on existing work solving protocol-specific challenges.

1.2 Survey Dimensions
This survey aims to provide an overview of the protocol-specific challenges, the corresponding
solutions, and the future directions. Specifically, this survey is organized around the following
dimensions:

• Dimension 1: Examine the differences between traditional fuzzing and protocol fuzzing.
• Dimension 2: Review how existing works address the challenges in protocol fuzzing.
• Dimension 3: Explore potential future directions in the field.

In Section 3, we provide an in-depth examination of the distinctive differences between protocols
and traditional fuzzing targets to address Dimension 1. Then, in Sections 4 to 6, we detail the
techniques used in existing protocol fuzzers to address Dimension 2. Lastly, Dimension 3 is discussed
in Section 7.

1.3 Collection Strategy
In this survey, we focus on stateful network protocols and the various techniques that are directly
related to the fuzz testing of their implementations. To collect the relevant publications, we followed
the procedures depicted in Fig. 1. First, we performed a preliminary reading and summarized 12
different keyword combinations that can be used to search for related works. Then, searching for

these keyword combinations on Google Scholar, we collected 544 published articles from January
2013 to June 2024. After that, we manually filtered out papers irrelevant to protocol fuzzing or
not published in influential publications listed in Table 1. At that time, the number of articles
was reduced to 87. Note that all pre-print papers were kept to remove publication bias [181]. And
a paper is relevant if its key contribution is in the scope of protocol fuzzing or that paper is a
bug detection tool and has picked at least one protocol implementation as its evaluation target.
The latter criterion is based on the heuristic that a bug detection tool probably has proposed
protocol-specific techniques if it uses protocol implementations as its evaluation targets. Next,
we performed snowballing and inverse snowballing to obtain a more comprehensive view. Six
more papers were added in this procedure. Finally, we applied the above collection process to the
released talks of several mainstream industrial security conferences such as BlackHat. 22 industrial
works were added, including 20 related talks and three open source protocol fuzzers with more than
50 stars on Github. The ascending trajectory of publications, as illustrated in Fig. 2, underscores
the burgeoning research interest in protocol fuzz testing, affirming its emergence as a focal point
within the field.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background knowl-
edge of protocol fuzzing. Section 3 introduces the main differences between general fuzzing targets
and protocols and then summarizes the major enhancements of existing protocol fuzzers. The next
three sections detail the existing techniques for each key component of protocol fuzzing. Section
4 discusses the progress in input generator component. Section 5 introduces the techniques for
improving the executor component. Section 6 manifests the taxonomy of oracles used in the bug
detector component. Section 7 offers future directions.

2 Background

2.1 Communication Protocols
A communication protocol is a set of rules that enables the exchange of information between two
or more entities within a communication system, utilizing any form of physical quantity variation.
The implementation of a communication protocol generally involves multiple phases [34]. First,
the protocol is conceptually designed, which includes defining the rules, behaviors, and functions it
will perform based on the protocol’s needs, taking into account factors such as efficiency, reliability,
scalability, and security. The outcome of the design phase is a set of specifications. Then, during
the development phase, the design of the protocol is translated into concrete implementations.
This can be in the form of software, hardware, or a combination of both. Once developed, the
protocol undergoes rigorous testing to confirm that it adheres to the protocol specifications and
meets the performance and reliability requirements. Among them, fuzzing, which this paper focuses
on, is a commonly used technology for testing protocol implementations. Eventually, the protocol
implementation will be deployed in a real-world environment.

In addition to the fundamental task of data exchange, protocols encompass a myriad of other
critical communication functionalities, introducing new layers of complexity [99]. This includes
tasks such as routing, detection of transmission errors, managing timeouts and retries, confirmations,
flow control, and sequence control. Each of these functionalities embodies a set of strategies and
implementations that collectively ensure the efficacy and reliability of communication protocols.
The intricate integration of these functions demonstrates the sophisticated nature of protocol
design and its pivotal role in modern communication systems.

2.2 Types of Protocols
Protocols can be classified from various perspectives, such as functionality, the accessibility of their
specifications, and their alignment with the layers of the OSI network reference model, as shown
in Fig. 3.

From a functional point of view, protocols exhibit a broad spectrum of varieties, each tailored
to fulfill unique operational objectives. For example, security protocols are designed primarily to
ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data, as exemplified by TLS [40] and DTLS (Datagram
Transport Layer Security) [134]. Routing protocols, such as BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), are
dedicated to efficiently managing the routes of data packets traversing the network. Furthermore,
application protocols, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web services and SMTP
(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email, are specialized to enable specific functionalities at the
application layer.

When considering the availability of protocol specifications, a distinction is drawn between
open protocols and proprietary protocols. Open protocols, like TCP, have publicly accessible spec-
ifications, allowing widespread scrutiny and implementation. In contrast, proprietary protocols
such as Microsoft’s RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) [106], are governed by individual entities,
with specifications that are not fully public. The availability of protocol specifications is crucial
for various stages of fuzzing, such as crafting inputs, constructing state machines, and detecting
bugs. It is important to clarify that the classification into open and proprietary pertains solely to the
availability of specifications and is independent of the accessibility of source codes for protocol
implementations.

Regarding the statefulness, protocols are bifurcated into stateful and stateless categories. Stateful
protocols, such as TLS [39, 153] and TCP [69], require multiple rounds of interaction. Stateless
protocols, such as UDP and HTTP, do not maintain state information across requests.

Based on the OSI network reference model, protocols can be classified into seven distinct layers:
physical, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application. The protocol layers
each solve a distinct class of communication problems. Among them, the lower-level protocols have
a higher coupling with the physical hardware. It is pertinent to note that not every protocol aligns
precisely with a single layer in the OSI model. For example, TLS/DTLS contains the functionality
of the session and representation layers; the Wi-Fi protocol contains the main functionality of

the physical and data link layers [2, 29]. Given varying interpretations of the protocol layering in
numerous sources, we categorize these protocols based on their primary functions.

3 Protocol Fuzzing Overview

3.1 Differences between protocol fuzzing and traditional fuzzing
In this subsection, we discuss the unique challenges associated with protocol fuzzing as identified
in the literature, addressing Survey Dimension 1. Protocol implementations differ from traditional
fuzzing targets in two key aspects: first, they exhibit higher communication complexity; second,
their testing environments are relatively more constrained. These differences not only highlight
the specificity of protocol fuzzing, but also correspond to a set of inherent challenges.

3.1.1 High communication complexity. The high complexity of communication can be discussed in
the following two aspects.

Respecting Semantic Constraints in Communication. Protocols serve as the backbone for
facilitating communication between different systems by providing a standardized set of rules
for message exchange. This communication is inherently complex, often involving a multi-round
process where multiple steps must be sequentially executed for the exchange to be successful.
Such protocols inherently require stateful implementations, with each stage of communication
building upon the previous one [1, 2, 40, 134]. In testing scenarios, this means that deeper layers
of the protocol implementation cannot be tested until the earlier constraints are satisfactorily
met – these are the strict semantic constraints inherent in communication protocols. Semantic
constraints come in two primary forms: intra-message and inter-message constraints. Intra-message
constraints pertain to the structure and content of individual messages, ensuring that data fields are
syntactically correct and semantically meaningful within the context of that message. Taking TCP
as an example, in a TCP segment, there are several critical fields such as the source port, destination
port, sequence number, acknowledgment number, data offset, and control flags (like SYN, ACK) [99].
Each of these fields must adhere to specific formats and rules. Inter-message constraints, on the
other hand, govern the relationship and sequence of multiple messages, requiring that they adhere
to the established protocol sequence and context for the conversation to progress [34]. For instance,
the establishment of a TCP connection involves a “three-way handshake" process: the client first
sends a SYN message, followed by the server responding with a SYN-ACK message, and finally, the
client sends an ACK message to complete the connection. Violations of either type of constraints
during communication can result in the fuzzing becoming non-progressive [69, 123, 153, 169, 200].
Testing Different Properties of Communication Process. Besides basic message exchange
functionality, protocols need to guarantee a series of additional features that form a more se-
cure or reliable communication such as time requirements, authentication, confidentiality, and
concurrency[68, 73, 76]. Effectively testing these attributes in implementations requires a more com-
plex form of testing that goes beyond typical application fuzzing, which mainly focuses on altering
structured inputs to find issues [97, 198]. Each attribute may require significant modification or even
a redesign of the fuzzing framework, including the development of specialized input generator, feed-
back mechanisms, and oracles to facilitate effective testing [31, 56, 66, 72, 93, 103, 149, 153, 169, 200].
For example, in the context of crafting a fuzzer that aims to detect traffic amplification attacks within
protocol implementations [79], an oracle is needed to identify disproportional request-to-response
data volume ratios, indicative of an amplification factor. Currently, the input generator needs to
be adeptly redesigned to generate specific variations of protocol messages that can maximize the
potential amplification factor. Moreover, the amplification factor can be used as a feedback to guide
the fuzzer in exploring the input space more effectively.

3.1.2 Constrained Testing Environment. Protocol fuzzing usually faces a constrained testing envi-
ronment due to the tight coupling between protocols and the hardware. Firstly, numerous protocols
are designed for communications between low-level physical devices or for communications occur-
ring in specialized sectors, such as protocols residing in the lower layers of the OSI reference model,
i.e., the physical and data link layers [1, 2, 5, 29, 150], or protocols designed for specific sectors such
as automotive [14, 115, 202], industrial control system (ICS) [21, 194], electrical grids, and aviation
systems. In these cases, the testing throughput will be limited by the hardware dependencies, such
as the lack of auotmation [120, 156], the bottleneck for scalable fuzzing [21, 138], etc. In addition,
these physical dependencies also limit the application of advanced fuzzing techniques. This is
because many advanced fuzzing techniques require greybox or whitebox testing information from
the test target, which cannot be satisfied due to the lack of program analysis frameworks on these
specific hardware [141, 201, 202].

3.2 Summary of Existing Protocol Fuzzers
A general fuzzer consists of three basic components, namely input generator, executor, and bug
collector. In one fuzzing iteration, input generator first produces a testing input to executor.
Then executor executes the PUT with the given input and collects runtime information for the
other two components. Finally, the bug collector checks the runtime information to determine
whether the input has triggered a bug.

The unique characteristics of protocols introduced in Section 3.1 present distinct challenges
in the design of these three components. The high communication complexity demands that the
input generator not only adheres to semantic constraints, including both intra- and inter-message
constraints, but also generates inputs from a multitude of testing perspectives to enhance the
discovery of vulnerabilities. Similarly, high communication complexity also poses challenges for
the bug detector, requiring it to detect whether test cases violate various security properties of the
communication process. Furthermore, the constraints of the testing environment impose limitations
on the executor’s scalability and its capability to collect runtime information, further influencing the
bug collector’s reliance on a limited set of bug detection mechanisms. These challenges underscore
the need for specialized adaptations in the fuzzing framework to effectively address the intricacies
of protocol testing.

We have analyzed current protocol fuzzing research and encapsulated these efforts into a technical
framework for protocol fuzzers, as depicted in Fig. 4. Note that existing protocol fuzzing work still
follows the high-level concepts of general fuzzing but proposes specific enhancements in these
subcomponents to solve protocol-specific challenges.

Input generator. Ideally, this component is responsible for generating inputs to expose vulnera-
bilities inside PUTs as effectively as possible. To realize this, protocol fuzzers usually implement

input generators with three main subphases including communication model construction, scheduling
and testcase construction.

Executor. In pursuit of an ideal executor for protocol fuzzing, contemporary research has
concentrated on two critical aspects: Efficient Execution and Runtime Information Extraction. The
former explores the development of an efficient, automated, and scalable testing environment,
enhancing the execution of protocol testing. The latter focuses on creating an analysis environment
that extracts essential runtime information, thereby informing and improving the input generation
and bug detection processes.

Bug collector. The primary objective of the bug collector component is twofold: to increase
the diversity of bug types it can detect and to enhance the accuracy of these detections. The
component is finely tuned to meticulously identify a broad spectrum of vulnerabilities, ranging
from memory-safety bugs like buffer overflows to more subtle non-memory-safety bugs such as
logic errors and specification violations.

4 Input Generator
In this section, we will introduce in detail how the existing work improves the input generator to
solve the unique challenges in protocol fuzzing. As shown in Table 2, we summarize the techniques
used in existing work in designing the three key phases in input generator. The covered works
are selected from our paper set as long as their main techniques are directly related to the input
generator. In addition to the statistics of the mentioned three phases for these works, the table also
lists their feedback information. According to Fig. 4, the feedback information can be provided by
the executor or the bug collector. We only discuss how the feedback information is used in input
generator but leave the details related to the feedback collection for Section 5.2.

4.1 Communication Model Construction
To enhance traditional fuzzers with semantic constraints, it is essential to develop a communication
model of the protocol to guide the fuzzing process. This communication model includes both a
state model and a data model. The state model details the transitions between different protocol
states, while the data model specifies the format and structure of the messages that drive these
state transitions. Typically, existing works represent the protocol’s communication model as a
state machine or its variants. A state machine is a data structure that describes the internal state
transitions of a protocol implementation. State machines can be represented as directed graphs, such
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) or a Mealy machine [39, 47, 55, 56, 132, 138, 153, 170]. In
these graphs, nodes represent the internal states of an entity, while edges represent state transitions
caused by receiving or sending certain types of messages. By referring to the communication model,
protocol fuzzers can be aware of the current target state, and can generate testcases according to
the data model of message types that are acceptable in the current state, thereby improving the
effectiveness of testcases. Note that a protocol implementation may have multiple communication
models, as it may behave differently depending on its working mode or configurations. For example,
a Wi-Fi device can be configured to run in AP-mode, STA-mode, or P2P-mode [23, 178] and a
SIP implementation can be configured as a client, server, or proxy [117], each of them reacts
differently to requests, thus having a different communication model. Most existing work treats
these implementations running in different configurations as different targets: They construct one
communication model for one given configuration.

In this section, we provide a taxonomy of the existing work based on its communication model
construction methods. As shown in Fig. 5, they are divided into two categories: (i) top-down
approaches, and (ii) bottom-up approaches.

4.1.1 Top-Down Approaches. Top-down approaches construct the protocol communication model
by learning from the textual description of the protocol, such as specifications or documents.
Top-down approaches require protocol specifications as input, thus are mostly used by open

protocols. Benefiting from global protocol knowledge of the specifications and the precisely defined
states and transitions, communication models constructed by top-down approaches are relatively
complete and accurate. It is worth noting that the constructed communication model may still
differ from the implementation’s. This is because developers may customize or extend the design
described in the specification according to the practical situation. This difference may affect the
final fuzzing performance. Methodologically, there are manual and automatic ways to construct
a communication model from the protocol documents.

Manual Construction (labeled as “manual” in Table 2 column 4): Most existing works construct
a communication model manually with considerable domain expertise [7, 8, 18, 55, 56, 63, 69, 70, 78,
120, 122, 136, 138, 149, 153, 200]. For example, Garbelini et al. [56] and GREYHOUND [55] construct
a holistic state machine of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi by referring to the core design
of the protocol specifications [1, 2, 29, 150] to guide fuzzing. Though manually constructing a
state machine is an error-prone and labor-intensive task, the benefit here is that human experts
can flexibly customize (tailor or extend) the state machine to maximize its effect toward the
work’s goal. For example, to detect state machine bugs caused by incorrect multiplexing between
different protocol modes, e.g., different protocol versions, extensions, authentication modes, or
key-exchange methods, Beurdouche et al. [18] manually construct a composite state machine
including all valid state transitions across protocol modes. That composite state machine is then
used to generate deviant traces as testcases to discover invalid state transitions. Similarly, FuzzPD
[77] is meticulously designed to accommodate the unique dual-role characteristic inherent in the
USB power delivery protocol (USBPD), where each device simultaneously functions as both a
power source and a power sink. By integrating the state machines of these two roles, FuzzBD is
able to support seamless switching of power roles on the fly during the fuzzing process. Unlike
the above-discussed works, some work chooses to learn partial information of a state machine for
guidance. Zou et al. propose TCP-Fuzz, a novel approach that incorporates 15 dependency rules
manually extracted from RFC documents. These rules encompass various dependencies, including
packet-to-packet, syscall-to-packet, and syscall-to-syscall interactions. Using these rules, TCP-Fuzz
adeptly generates testcases by simultaneously producing the interdependent packets and syscalls.
Another example is L2Fuzz [120]. The authors construct a map delineating the valid commands
pertinent to each of the 19 states identified in the protocol. This mapping facilitates the generation
of testcases that are specifically tailored to produce commands acceptable in the current state,
thereby enhancing the relevance and effectiveness of the testing process. Some works also address
the problem that the communication models between the specification and implementation are not
completely equal. Using heterogeneous Single-Sign-On (SSO) platforms as an example, MoSSOT
[149] constructs a state machine of a regular SSO process first and then analyzes the practical
SSO network traffics of different SSO platforms to learn the implementation details, such as key
parameters in each action. These implementation details refine the state transition conditions in
the state machines of different SSO platforms.

Automatic Construction: To automate the error-prone and labor-intensive process of manual
communication model construction, some works automatically retrieve the semantic constraint

from the protocol specification [13, 118]. For example, RESTler [13] learns the message dependency
relationships based on the return types from Swagger specification, which is a structural specifica-
tion format describing the RESTful API endpoints, methods, parameters and return types. Pacheco
et al. propose to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract a finite state machine (FSM)
from the protocol specifications [118]. Note that these two papers are not listed in Table 2 since
these works are not building stateful protocol fuzzers. With the advancement of large language
model (LLM) technology, numerous studies have begun to employ LLM techniques to automate the
learning and comprehension of protocol specifications, such as mGPTFuzz[94], CHATAFL[104]
and LLMIF[172]. These approaches aim to provide guidance during fuzzing processes, particularly
in inferring the current protocol state and generating appropriate test messages. The integration of
LLMs offers a promising avenue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of protocol fuzzing by
leveraging their sophisticated language understanding capabilities to interpret complex protocol
specifications and guide the testing strategy accordingly.

4.1.2 Bottom-Up Approaches. Bottom-Up approaches provide another solution for communication
model reconstruction. These approaches utilize the observable information of a protocol implemen-
tation to reconstruct the communication model. Since they do not rely on textual documentation
or specifications, they are suitable for proprietary protocols. Unlike top-down approaches, which
have clear definitions of protocol states in the documents, the definitions of states in bottom-up
approaches are purpose-specific and may vary among use cases, methods, and implementations.
For example, AFLNET [123] determines a protocol state according to the status code of the PUT’s
response. Another example is StateAFL [110], which groups the memory layout of long-lived
memory as different states. From the learning source’s point of view, these methods can be divided
into two categories, namely traffic analysis-based approaches and program analysis-assisted
approaches.

Traffic-Analysis-Based Approaches: The traffic-analysis-based methods focus on recon-
structing the protocol communication model purely from the observed network traffic traces
[39, 47, 91, 123, 173, 194]. This kind of approach is easy to operate and works well in cases that
the program execution cannot be traced, e.g., cannot obtain the firmware containing the target
program. The traffic analysis-based communication model construction approaches can be passive
or active.

• Passive learning (labeled as “TAPL” in Table 2 column 4) methods mainly rely on a set of
pre-collected network traces of the PUT with other entities to infer the communication
model [44, 57, 186, 194]. The learning algorithms proposed by existing works can be divided
into two categories: statistics-based and neural network-based algorithms. For the former
category, Pulsar [57] builds a second-order Markov model by computing the probability of
the occurrence of the adjacent messages in the network trace corpus and then minimizes
this Markov model into a DFA. After receiving a message, Pulsar matches it with one of the
states in the inferred DFA to select a valid response template for building a new testcase. For
the latter category, Fan et al. [44] and SeqFuzzer[194] use LSTM to learn the grammar and
temporal features of stateful protocols. Specifically, they employ Long short-term memory
(LSTM) as the encoder and decoder of the sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model [165].
Seq2seq model is an encoder-decoder model structure that can handle input and output
sequences of different lengths. The encoder LSTM model learns the features of the protocol
via captured network traces, while the decoder LSTM model is used to generate fuzzing
inputs. Passive network trace-based state machine learning methods are easy to operate and
fast-running. However, the quality of the constructed state machine depends on the coverage
of captured traffics. In practice, it is hard to capture a comprehensive set of message types

111:12

and sequences, causing the constructed communication model to lack parts of uncaptured
states or state transitions.

• Active learning (labeled as “TAAL” in Table 2 column 4) methods involve learning the com-
munication model during the fuzzing process [4, 38, 39, 47, 48, 53, 54, 90, 101, 123, 139, 185].
These approaches can be categorized on the basis of whether the global state set is predefined.
The first category does not define the global state set in advance, i.e., meaning it
does not predetermine the number and nature of possible states in the state machine. This
approach employs automata active learning algorithms to discern the state machine of the
target. The learning algorithms are based on user-defined input/output alphabets and map-
pers between alphabets and concrete messages. Starting from an empty state machine, these
algorithms iteratively propose and refine the model by interacting with the target protocol
implementation, ceasing only when no counterexamples to the learned state machine are
found. Most works in this category [4, 38, 39, 47, 48, 101, 139] utilize Angluin’s 𝐿∗ algorithm,
defining input alphabets based on protocol specifications and translating these into actual
messages using message templates. DYNPRE [88] incorporates an adaptive message rewriting
technique to manage session-specific identifiers while interacting with the server. It uses
byte-level mutations and server feedback to deduce the meaning and format of messages,
identify different message types, and create a precise and minimal protocol state machine
based on observed message patterns. Conversely, the second category pre-defines the
state set through a rule-based method to circumvent the complexities of automata learning
algorithms, and learns the transitions between states by mutating known messages. For
example, AFLNET [123] uses response message status codes to infer the current protocol
state, mutating real message sequences to uncover transitions. Bleem [90] utilizes the Scapy
library to parse messages and abstract them into various message types by retaining all fields
of the enumeration type. This strategy is based on empirical observations from more than
50 protocols supported by Scapy, where different enumeration field values typically signify
distinct packet or frame types. Bleem then uses these abstracted message traces to construct
a guiding graph for fuzzing. Another example is Braktooth [53], which defines eight rules
that map messages to states based on message characteristics. It operates as a proxy between
the PUT and a standard protocol stack, mutating communications to explore additional state
transitions. Similarly, Garbelini et al.[54] establish mapping rules to identify states and learn
the state machine using capture traces (i.e., pcap files).

Program-Analysis-Assisted Approaches (labeled as “PAL” in Table 2 column 4): Compared
with traffic-analysis-based approaches, program-analysis-assisted approaches additionally use
internal execution information to construct the communication model. In general, internal execution
information includes the results of static and dynamic program analysis, which requires not
only the access to the program but also the availability of analysis frameworks such as program
instrumentation tools. Based on the type of internal execution information used, existing work can
be divided into execution-trace-based and state-variable-based. Execution-Trace-Based approaches
recognize different internal execution states according to the execution trace of the target. For
example, ICS3Fuzzer[45] dynamically instruments the target supervisory software to collect the
trace. By comparing the identity of the execution traces, ICS3Fuzzer can distinguish whether the
PUT is in a different state. The state-variable-based approaches detect protocol state transitions
by tracking the value changes of state variables during input processing [15, 102, 110, 127]. These
approaches are based on the simple observation that most protocol implementations use certain
variables to store the current state. Therefore, they identify these variables as state variables and
use their values to distinguish between different states. For example, StateAFL [110] identifies

A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing

111:13

possible state variables by identifying long-lived data structures in memory snapshots. Similarly,
STATEINSPECTOR [102] identifies state variables by locating memory regions in heap memory that
kept the same values in the execution of each message sequence. Differently, SGFuzz [15] identifies
state variables through regular expressions by automatically extracting all enum type variables
that are assigned at least once. The insight behind this approach is based on the investigation that
most protocol implementations use enum-type state variables. STATELIFTER [148] views the loops
in protocol parsers as the core of the state machine. Through static analysis, it traverses the loop
structures in the code and maps the different paths that each loop iteration may execute to distinct
states. The dependencies between loop iterations are treated as state transitions within the state
machine. ParDiff [195] uses static symbolic analysis to extract finite state machines (FSMs) from
protocol implementations by identifying and converting the relevant message parsing constraints
into ordered state transitions.

Some works have also used program analysis-assisted approaches to construct the data models
of protocol implementations [22, 35, 147, 163]. Polyglot [22] leverages dynamic binary analysis
to extract protocol information by closely monitoring how a program processes network data,
revealing intricate protocol semantics and structures without source code dependency. Recent work
Netlifter[147] uses static analysis to derive precise protocol specifications directly from source
code, employing Abstract Format Graphs (AFG) to capture and visualize complex data structure
relationships and dependencies with high accuracy. Spenny[163] integrates dynamic analysis with
symbolic execution to precisely reverse-engineer industrial control system protocols.

4.2 Task Scheduling
In the realm of recent protocol fuzzing research, the scheduling phase has been distinctly categorized
based on the methodology employed to handle state-related complexities. This classification leads
to two primary categories: Hierarchical Approaches and Monolithic Approaches.

Hierarchical Approaches decompose the scheduling process into two discrete phases: (1) Inter-
state scheduling: This phase involves selecting a state to fuzz using a state scheduling algorithm
based on the priority or relevance of the state. (2)Intra-state scheduling: Once the target state
is selected, a general scheduling algorithm is applied to optimize fuzzing within that state. By
separating these phases, hierarchical approaches allow for more nuanced control over the fuzzing
process. For example, if we want to test a protocol after a handshake is completed, the inter-
state scheduling phase will first prioritize this state. Then, the intra-state scheduling phase will
generate specific test cases to be executed within the post-handshake state using traditional
scheduling methods (e.g., seed scheduling, byte scheduling, mutation strategy scheduling). In
this paradigm, the heuristics used by the scheduling process mainly fall into three categories,
namely rarity-preferred (SRHS in Table 2 column 5), performance-preferred (SPHS in Table 2
column 5), and complexity-preferred (SCHS in Table 2 column 5), as detailed in Table 3. Rarity-
preferred heuristics allocate more resources to seldomly exercised states, hypothesizing that these
states harbor more undiscovered adjacent states or code logics [19, 110, 123, 162]. Performance-
preferred heuristics prioritize states demonstrating higher code coverage or bug discovery rates
[30, 55, 56, 110, 123]. Furthermore, some works utilize complexity-preferred heuristics, favoring
states with greater complexity (i.e., connected to more basic blocks) or deeper states (i.e., further
from the initial state) [45, 57]. For example, ICS3Fuzzer [45] inclines to choose the deeper states and
those states that exercise more basic blocks. As a generation-based fuzzer, Pulsar [57] calculates
the weight of all states that can be reached from the current state and then selects the state that
has the maximum weight to be tested next. In detail, the weight of a state is calculated as the
sum of all mutable fields in a fixed number of transitions. However, since all these state selection
algorithms are implemented and evaluated separately on different platforms and targets, it is

difficult to make a fair comparison and achieve conclusive findings. Liu et al. [85] evaluate the
three existing state selection algorithms of AFLNet [123], including a rarity-preferred algorithm,
an algorithm that randomly selects states, and a sequential state selection algorithm. They find
that these algorithms achieved very similar results in terms of code coverage. They attribute the
reasons to the coarse-grained state abstraction of AFLNET and the inaccurate estimation of the
state productivity. Therefore, they propose the AFLNETLEGION algorithm [85] to address these
issues, which is based on a variant of the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm [84].

In contrast, monolithic approaches employ a single, unified scheduling phases where state-
related information is integrated directly into the scheduling algorithm. This means that the
scheduler considers the performance of seeds in various states as part of its decision-making process,
rather than treating state transitions and test case generation as separate steps. For example, SGFuzz
[15] divides the states into rare states and normal states according to the exercised times. When
assigning energy to seeds, it calculates the proportion of the rare states that are exercised by each
seed and adds this proportion as one of the parameters on the basis of the original power scheduling
algorithm. In a similar way, SGFuzz assigns more energy to the seeds containing state transitions
that correspond to the expected protocol behaviors. This is because SGFuzz expects that these valid
state transitions are easier to be mutated to other invalid state transitions, thus incurring error
handling logic. Similarly, LTL-Fuzzer [103] also schedules the entire seed, prioritizing seeds that
are closer to the target code locations during execution.

In addition to state-related information, many works utilize other categories of information for
scheduling purposes. However, the scheduling algorithms based on these categories of information
are generally universal and have been well discussed in the literature [97, 198]. Therefore, we did
not discuss them in detail.

4.3 Testcase Construction
The construction strategy used in protocol fuzzing can be categorized into packet-level and sequence-
level.

4.3.1 Packet-Level Construction Strategy (labeled as “Packet" in Table 2 column 6). Packet-Level
construction strategies of protocol fuzzers basically inherit the common strategies of general fuzzers.
For example, elements such as relation, fixup and transform in Peach Fuzzer [41] are often used
to describe the relationships between protocol fields such as length, checksums, and encoding
transformations. General mutation methods like bit flip and set zero are also commonly used in
generating packet-level testcases. In this paragraph, more consideration is given to the construction
strategies that take advantage of protocol-specific characteristics to reduce input space or improve
the effectiveness of bug triggering. For the former purpose (i.e., reducing input space), SPIDER[81]
leverages the domain-specific insight that most Openflow messages trigger new system events
in existing SDN controllers that affect state computation and resource footprints. Based on the
insight, SPIDER can directly generate event sequences rather than generating Openflow messages,
significantly reducing the input space. In addition, L2Fuzz [120] divides the L2CAP packet format
into the field that can be mutated and keeps the other fields unchanged to generate testcases that

A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing

are less likely to be rejected. IPSpex [197] combines network traffic and execution traces of network
packet construction to extract the message field semantics of ICS protocols. Strategies targeting the
later purpose (i.e., improving the effectiveness of triggering bugs) are mainly heuristics summarized
from practices. For example, EmNetTest [8] systematically generates validly constructed packets
with invalid header fields or truncated headers. The insight behind this strategy is gained from a
comprehensive study of 61 reported vulnerabilities in Embedded Network Stacks (ENS). Similar
strategies are mentioned in many industry conference works. BadMesher [128] adopts several
domain-specific strategies, such as setting the length field to margin values, and randomly deleting
some fields, to improve the effectiveness of triggering bugs in Wi-Fi mesh devices. Yen et al. [183]
find that some strategies such as mutating the ID field to a nonexisting ID, changing the port
number or length field to a boundary value (e.g., 0xFF/0x00), and changing IP to some random
addresses, can be quite effective in fuzzing Data Distribution Service (DDS) protocol. Similarly,
BrokenMesh [179] adopts some strategies such as mutating the packet count or the length field in
fuzzing the Bluetooth Mesh protocol. TaintBFuzz [133] employs static taint analysis to identify the
connections between Zigbee protocol fields and the variables used to make path decisions in Zigbee
implementations, thereby prioritizing mutations that are anticipated to reveal additional code paths
and improve the efficacy of testing. MPFuzz [89] uses a global synchronization mechanism to share
key field information across different fuzzing instances and performs targeted mutations based on
the semantic characteristics of these fields, making it easier to discover potential vulnerabilities.

Sequence-Level Construction Strategy (labeled as “Sequence" in Table 2 column 6). Protocol
4.3.2
fuzzers may adopt some sequence-level construction strategies. These strategies proactively con-
struct message sequences that deviate from the regular protocol state machine, expecting to trigger
more non-memory-safety bugs of the PUT. Generation-based fuzzers and mutation-based
fuzzers operate differently in sequence-level construction.

(1) Generation-Based Fuzzers: These fuzzers construct message sequences leveraging estab-
lished protocol knowledge, such as standard state machines and inter-message dependency
relationships. Notable examples include works [18, 131, 153, 169] that generate aberrant
message traces by applying strategies like the addition or removal of random protocol mes-
sages to valid sequences derived from standard state machines. Projects like Sweyntooth
[56], Greyhound [55], and Braktooth [53] meticulously monitor state transitions of PUT and
strategically inject valid packets at incorrect states to elicit anomalies, in accordance with the
state machine model. Recent research by Fiterau-Brostean et al.[49] proposes a novel method
for detecting state machine bugs by inputting a catalog of finite automatons which indicate
certain types of state machine bugs, as well as a model of the PUT’s. It can then analyze the
models and produces testcases that expose the bug.

(2) Mutation-Based Fuzzers: These fuzzers predominantly employ simple yet effective strate-
gies to mutate the message sequences of seeds. This includes techniques such as packet
shuffling, random insertion, or deletion. For instance, AFLNET [123] constructs message
sequences by maintaining a pool of messages from network traces that can be integrated into
or substituted for existing seeds. AFLNET further employs a blend of byte-level and sequence-
level operators, including replacement, insertion, duplication, and deletion of messages, to
craft the message sequences. Similarly, DYFuzzing [8] mutates seeds and applies Dolev-Yao
(DY) attacker strategies. Frankenstein [138] reorganizes known message sequences to en-
hance code coverage. He et al. [63] propose a unique fuzzer for the 5G non-access-stratum
(NAS) protocol, which extracts packets from captures into a structured message table. This
fuzzer then applies different mutation techniques tailored to the types of key fields within the

protocol messages, significantly enhancing the intelligence and precision of the message mu-
tation process. For example, length fields are mutated combining boundary and intermediate
values, including 0, maximum, minimum, and random intermediate values. It is important to
note that mutation-based fuzzers must judiciously manage the correlation of specific fields
in message sequences, such as session numbers, counters, or timestamps. Indiscriminate
mutations in these fields could render the input ineffective and lead to early rejection. To
address this challenge, AFLNET [123] modifies the code of the PUT to use a fixed session
number 1, thus ensuring the effectiveness of the fuzzing process.

5 Executor
In this section, we will introduce the key improvements of protocol fuzzers in the executor in
detail. As shown in Fig. 6, an executor in protocol fuzzing normally includes four key processes.
First, the executor needs to prepare an executable execution environment for PUT (①. Execution
Environment Preparation), and then send input to PUT through the input feeding mechanism (②.
Input Feeding), extract runtime information during the input processing (③. Information Extraction),
and reset the execution state and the environment state to a specific state after the execution of the
current iteration is complete (④. Execution Reset).

In Table. 4, we summarize the key techniques and improvements in efficient execution (including
①, ②, ④) and runtime information extraction (③) of the existing protocol fuzzing works. The works
in the table are selected from the collection of papers because they are directly related to the
executor.

5.1 Efficient Execution
In protocol fuzzing, there are commonly two directions to improve the fuzzing efficiency: 1)
establishing an execution environment that enables parallel testing for scalability improvement
(① in Fig. 6); 2) reducing the execution cost of each testing iteration (② and ④ in Fig. 6).

Scalability Improvement. Scalable fuzzing, in this context, refers to the capacity to create
5.1.1
multiple testing environments for parallel fuzzing. This is crucial in protocol fuzzing, where many
fuzzing targets are closely bounded to hardware. The traditional approach for parallel testing of
purchasing multiple physical devices can be economically burdensome and inefficient. For protocol
fuzzing, since many fuzzing targets depend on specialized execution environments, concurrent
testing of these targets can only be carried out by purchasing multiple physical devices, leading to
high economic costs and waste.

Emulation emerges as a key solution for scalable fuzzing. It offers a virtual execution environment
for the PUT, reducing the dependency on specialized hardware and facilitating the creation of
numerous parallel testing instances. This capability significantly enhances scalability, allowing for
extensive fuzzing operations across multiple environments. Some of the protocol fuzzers leverage
the existing emulation solutions to scale the fuzzing process (labeled as “CUVM" in Table. 4 column
4)[69, 122, 142, 149, 162].

However, two difficulties hinder the usage of emulation in protocol fuzzing. The first is the
availability of the protocol implementation binary, as many firmware images are not publicly
available. Second, compared to the diversity of hardware, existing emulators can only support
a small fraction of them. These difficulties lead to a lot of work still performing fuzzing in a
hardware-in-the-loop way (labeled as “HIL" in Table. 4 column 4) [46, 55, 56, 58, 91, 120].

Some works address these issues according to the characteristics of different devices (labeled
as “SE" in Table. 4 column 4). For the first challenge, existing work obtains the target binaries by
intercepting Over-The-Air (OTA) firmware updates, or extracting using vendor-specific command or
debugging ports. For example, Frankenstein [138] leverages the Patchram mechanism, a Broadcom
vendor-specific command that can be used to temporarily patch breakpoints to the ROM, to take
the memory snapshot of a physical Bluetooth chip and emulate it in an unmodified version of
QEMU. To address the second challenge, the existing work often uses an approach called rehosting
to partially emulate the functionality of the physical hardware [87, 96]. For example, BaseSafe [96]
selectively rehosts several signaling message parser functions utilizing the Unicorn engine, which
is a popular CPU emulator [129].

5.1.2 Execution Cost Reduction. Another direction to improve fuzzing efficiency is to optimize the
intermediate execution steps in each iteration. In the following, we present the progress of existing
work towards this direction, which mainly focuses on two subprocedures: input feeding (② in
Fig. 6) and execution reset (④ in Fig. 6), specifically.

Input Feeding. Input feeding mechanism acts as a pipeline between the input generator and
the PUT to pass the testcase to the PUT for parsing and execution. According to the Inter-Process
Communication (IPC) mechanisms that the communication between Fuzzer and PUT relies on,
existing approaches can be roughly divided into four categories, namely OTA-based, socket-based,
shared-memory-based, and file-based approaches. OTA- and socket-based approaches are mostly
used when the fuzzer and PUT cannot be deployed on the same physical device. The latter two
approaches can be used to speed up input feeding when the PUT and the fuzzer can be deployed
on the same device.

• OTA-Based Input Feeding (labeled as “OTA" in Table. 4 column 5). In general, OTA-based
input feeding mechanisms are mostly used in the scenario of fuzzing the implementations of
protocols that are typically closed in nature and tightly integrated with hardware components,
such as Wi-Fi [55, 152, 169], Bluetooth (including classic Bluetooth and BLE) [53, 56, 120], LTE
[96], Zigbee [95], 4G/5G [54, 63] and SMS/MMS protocols [58]. In this approach, PUT and
the fuzzer need to be deployed in adjacent physical spaces and communicate with each other
on specific frequency bands. Thus, OTA-based fuzzers require the use of radio-frequency
transceiver devices with receive and transmit functions, such as a software-defined radio
(SDR) to handle signals over a wide tuning range. OTA-based fuzzing provides the capability
to test the entire protocol stack including the physical layer. However, OTA-based approaches
are the slowest among the above-mentioned approaches. Therefore, many wireless protocol
fuzzers try to use other input feeding mechanisms to have better performance, which will be
introduced in the following.

• Socket-Based Input Feeding (labeled as “Socket" in Table. 4 column 5). Socket-based input
feeding mechanisms are mostly used in protocol implementations based on TCP/IP infras-
tructures. In common cases under these approaches, the fuzzer and the PUT communicate
with each other through IP addresses, via socket mechanisms including TCP socket and UDP
socket. The socket-based approaches include two deployment modes, one is point-to-point
(P2P) communication between the fuzzer and PUT [9, 28, 47, 82, 103, 110, 123, 170, 200]. The
fuzzer can play the role of a client or server depending on the role of the PUT. The other
deployment mode is Man-in-the-middle (MiTM), in which the fuzzer acts as a proxy between
two communication parties and performs mutation or injection to the normal communication
traffic [69, 122]. The MiTM-based input feeding is mostly used in the scenario where the
protocol involves certain contextual information (checksum, packet sequences, etc.) that

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.

A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing

111:19

cannot keep valid by mutating static seeds. However, both modes need to address two chal-
lenges. First, socket communication is quite heavy and involves lots of context switches.
Existing works improve the efficiency of the socket-based input feeding mechanisms by
avoiding the use of these expensive network functions. For example, SnapFuzz [9] replaces
the original internet socket with UNIX domain socket [33], a lightweight IPC mechanism
that does not have the routing, checksum calculation operations that IP sockets have. Second,
it’s hard for the fuzzer to determine whether the PUT has already finished processing the
previous message and is ready to receive the next message. The PUT may reject the messages
coming too early when the target is not ready, thus causing the fuzzer to desynchronize
from its state machine. To solve this issue, Fiterau-Brostean et al. [47] and AFLNET [123] set
static time intervals to wait for the PUT to initialize, process requests, and send responses.
However, static timers are too coarse-grained and can waste a lot of time waiting for the
timeout, thus slowing down the fuzzing process. SnapFuzz [9] and AMPFuzz [79] develop
a more fine-grained method to inspect the state of the socket. Specifically, they use the
function call to related network system calls such as 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑣 (), 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑣 𝑓 𝑟𝑜𝑚() as a sign of ready to
receive the next message. They monitor all these function calls through binary rewriting and
compile-time code instrumentation, and then notify the fuzzer to send the next iteration of
input.

• File-Based Input Feeding (labeled as “File" in Table. 4 column 5). File-based input feeding
leverages static or dynamic instrumentation techniques to replace heavy network operations
with file operations to achieve a performance boost. For example, Yurong et al. [30] transform
socket communication to file operations using preloading customized libraries [189] under
the circumstance that the source code of the PUT is not available. Similarly, Nyx-net [142]
injects a library into the target to hook the network functions of the target connection to
obtain their associated file descriptors and injected fuzzing input to the right place.

• Shared-Memory-Based Input Feeding (labeled as “Shared-Memory" in Table. 4 column 5).
Shared-Memory-Based input feeding writes the fuzzing input to the address of shared memory
and hooks the related functions to read the testcase from shared memory [17, 51, 96, 138]. For
example, BaseSafe [96] executes each generated testcase in a forked copy of the target process,
and the input for each run is copied to the appropriate address in the corresponding child
process. Similarly, Frankenstein [138] creates a virtual modem to inject custom packets. The
fuzzed input is written to the receive buffer in RAM that is mapped to the hardware receive
buffer using direct memory access (DMA). Also, HNPFuzzer [51] emulates network functions
based on shared memory to reduce the time consumption due to message transmission
between fuzzer and PUT.

• Others. There are also works that rely on specialized communication channels to feed fuzzing
inputs. For example, to fuzz the client of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Park et al.
leverage the virtual channel, an abstraction layer in RDP that is used to transport data,
to actively send fuzzing input from the server to the client [119]. Song et al. use a media
converter to convert traffic between Automotive Ethernet and standard Gigabit Ethernet,
and fuzz the SOME/IP protocol stack of the electronic control unit (ECU) [156], which is a
control communication protocol between ECUs.

Execution Reset. After each iteration of execution, it is necessary to reset the PUT to a
specified state and wait for the next iteration of fuzzing. This is because each testcase may affect
both the internal execution states of the PUT (e.g., global variables) or influence the execution
environment (e.g., file system, databases). Execution without reset makes the PUT behave more
non-deterministicly, making it harder to reproduce the bugs. For example, when fuzzing an FTP

111:20

To be filled, et al.

server, a testcase may cause a file to be created under the shared folder. If the shared folder is not
reset, the FTP server will report an error if the following testcase tries to create a file with the same
name, which means that the same testcase results in different behavior of PUT.

Based on the analysis of the reset of execution methods of existing work, the process mainly
involves three key sub-phases, which are 1. reset time selection, 2. execution state reset and 3. execution
environment reset. Firstly, the executor assesses whether the current iteration has been concluded
during the reset time selection phase. This determination precedes any actions taken to reset the
execution. Once it is confirmed that the current execution cycle is complete, the process continues
with the execution state reset and execution environment reset, which reset the runtime state of the
PUT and the associated external execution environments, respectively. Below we summarize the
progress of existing works in these three key phases separately.

1. Reset Strategy Selection. A reset strategy is mainly used to determine the appropriate time or
execution point for performing a reset, which has a significant influence on the performance of
fuzzing. An early reset may cause the target to terminate when it is still performing some tasks that
may be vulnerable, and a late reset may affect the efficiency of the test. A common approach is to set
a fixed time interval before resetting the execution. For example, AFLNET [123] allows the user to
manually configure the time delays before restarting the PUT. However, this approach is relatively
coarse-grained and it is hard to determine an appropriate time interval. In order to precisely control
when to reset the execution, some works use program analysis to find the location that indicates
the end of the execution of an iteration, and instrument the target program to terminate at these
code locations [9, 79, 127, 142]. For example, AMPFuzz [79] performs static analysis and injects
termination calls into code branches that do not contain message-sending APIs. In addition, some
works choose not to perform an execution reset after each fuzzing iteration for performance boost.
For example, Charon [201] leverage a program status inferring module to infer the time point at
which the PUT has finished processing the packet, thereby detecting the coverage of specific inputs
and avoiding the need to repeatedly restart the PUT to collect feedback. Similarly, SGFuzz [15]
does not restart the PUT in every iteration. Instead, it performs a post-analysis to attribute the
relationship between inputs and the target program’s behavior. Specifically, it collects all the inputs
on which the PUT has been executed and minimizes the input list to a minimal message sequence
that can trigger the bug.

2. Execution State Reset. Execution state reset is responsible for resetting the context of the running
PUT process to a specified state, including the data in registers and memory, etc. The existing
execution state reset mechanisms can be divided into three categories, namely message-based reset,
process restart, and snapshot & recovery.

Message-based reset (labeled as “MR" in Table. 4 column 6) operates by sending a specific type
of message that forces the PUT to terminate the ongoing session and revert to its initial state
[21, 47, 169]. For instance, when fuzzing the Wi-Fi Access Point (AP), WiFuzz uses a deauthentication
message to reset its state [169]. Message-based reset is easy-to-use, but it only supports a limited
set of protocols as not every protocol is designed with a reset message. Furthermore, while it can
reset the explicit protocol state of the PUT, it cannot reset the implicit state of the test target, such
as global variables and memory that has been allocated but not freed.

Another commonly used approach to reset the execution state is to kill the target process and
restart (labeled as “ProcR" in Table. 4 column 6) [28, 45, 92]. However, it is a relatively heavy
operation for fuzzing, as the restart of the program involves multiple expensive pre-processing
steps, such as loading the program into memory, dynamic linking, etc., resulting in inefficiencies.
The snapshot & recovery mechanism has been integrated into fuzzing. This approach involves
checkpointing PUT at a specific runtime state and then resetting it back to that checkpoint after each
fuzzing iteration. This method effectively bypasses the repeated execution of resource-intensive

A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing

111:21

initialization operations, thereby enhancing fuzzing efficiency. Protocol fuzzing, in particular,
derives significant benefits from snapshot technology. Protocols are predominantly stateful, which
implies that the input often comprises multiple prefix messages that guide the PUT to a designated
state before introducing the crafted message. It is common for testcases to share the same prefix
message sequences, especially when a specific state requires repeated exploration. Implementing
snapshot technology in the protocol fuzzing process eliminates redundant executions associated
with parsing these shared packet sequences, thereby markedly boosting fuzzing efficiency. The
snapshot methodologies used in the current protocol fuzzing research can be broadly categorized
into two types: process-level snapshots and virtual machine-level snapshots.

• Process-Level snapshot mechanisms (labeled as “PSR" in Table. 4 column 6) rely on system
call capabilities provided by the operating system to realize their functionality. Generally,
based on the APIs used, existing methods can be categorized into two types: fork-based and
ptrace-based. Fork-based snapshot mechanisms are widely used in several well-known general-
purpose fuzzers, including AFL[188]. Specifically, AFL inserts a piece of fork-server code into
the PUT program binary, which is executed before the 𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛() function. Following a signal
from the AFL fuzzing side, the fork-server generates a child process via the 𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑘 () function,
and this child process continues with the 𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛() function. Since the fork-server has already
loaded all kinds of resources, each child process only needs to execute the main function’s code,
thereby bypassing the costly preprocessing steps and enhancing efficiency. This mechanism
has been adopted by many protocol fuzzers for state resetting [9, 51, 82, 91, 96, 110, 123, 127].
Furthermore, some works have extended the original fork-server mechanism in AFL to
allow conditional multiple initializations at different code points, enabling the fuzzer to
conveniently switch between various states of the protocol and thus boosting the fuzzing
process [9, 30]. Ptrace-based snapshot mechanisms, such as CRIU and DMTCP, leverage the
debugging API 𝑝𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑒 () to collect all the process context information and save it as image files
[82]. In the restoration process, these snapshot mechanisms read the dumped image files and
recreate the process using syscalls such as 𝑓 𝑜𝑟𝑘 () or 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒 (). Unlike the fork-based snapshot,
which requires predetermined snapshot conditions (i.e., the location of the fork-server call)
before execution, ptrace-based snapshots can checkpoint at any state during runtime.

• Virtual-Machine-Level snapshot mechanisms (labeled as “VMSR" in Table. 4 column
6) utilize the capabilities of virtual machine hypervisors to capture snapshots of the entire
virtual machine at a specific time point, typically facilitated through a hypercall [142, 149].
When hypercalls are invoked, the program running within the virtual machine exits the VM
context and transfers control to the hypervisor. Although the hypervisor-based approach
is user-friendly, requiring no instrumentation, it is somewhat less efficient and more space-
consuming because of its large granularity. To enhance the practicality of using virtual
machine-level snapshots in protocol fuzzing, Nyx-net [142] implements an incremental
snapshot approach to reduce the overhead associated with creating and removing snapshots.
Specifically, Nyx-net establishes a root snapshot in pristine state, and each execution iteration
commences from this root snapshot. In subsequent fuzzing iterations, Nyx-net generates
incremental snapshots based on the root snapshot following the execution of an input message.
Consequently, Nyx-net has a great performance boost on the testcases that share the same
prefix message sequences.

3. Execution Environment Reset. The reset of the execution environment primarily involves
resetting the filesystem or database that may be affected by the PUT. Many fuzzers require users
to provide a cleanup script to revert all changes [51, 82, 110, 123, 127], necessitating substantial
manual effort to analyze the PUT’s potential impact on the external environment. To address this

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.

111:22

issue, Snapfuzz [9] leverages a custom in-memory filesystem, where modifications are automatically
discarded after the completion of a fuzzing iteration. Furthermore, the hypervisor-based snapshot
mechanism. In addition, the hypervisor-based snapshot mechanism (VMSR in Table. 4 column 7)
[142], which captures the state of the entire virtual machine, can reset both the execution state and
the environment simultaneously.

5.2 Runtime Information Extraction
In general, the runtime information extraction methods used in existing works can be divided into
three categories according to their generality.

Hardware-Assisted methods (labeled as “HA” in Table 4 column 9) capitalize on the unique
capabilities inherent to certain specialized hardware devices to glean runtime information. A prime
example of this method is demonstrated by Nyx-net [142], which employs Intel Processor Trace
(Intel PT). This feature, unique to certain high-end Intel CPUs, allows for the detailed recording of
software execution aspects, such as control flow paths, thus enabling the comprehensive collection
of in-depth coverage information.

Software-Based methods leverage the capability of the software execution environment, e.g.,
compiler, operating system, virtual machine hypervisor, etc., to obtain the runtime information.
Instrumentation is the most commonly used method for realizing runtime information extraction,
which inserts information collection function calls into the program at specific code point. Program
instrumentation can be static (labeled as “SSI ” in Table 4 column 9) or dynamic (labeled as “SDI ” in
Table 4 column 9) [45, 64, 119]. The former happens before the PUT runs and can be performed
at compile time [15, 82, 91, 92, 103, 110, 123, 132, 142, 200] or by directly rewriting the binary [9].
The latter happens while the PUT is running, leveraging tools such as DynamoRIO [119] or Frida
[64] to inject hooking functions at specific code points to collect runtime information.

Externally-Observable-Behavior-Based methods are the most general class of methods,
as it does not rely on any support of the execution environment and can be used in a blackbox
manner. There are various externally observable behaviors, such as the output of the program
(labeled as “Resp” in Table 4 column 9) and the side-channel information such as power consumption
and response time. The heuristics behind these observable behavior-based methods are that the
differences in these behaviors can represent the PUT is under different states or having gone
through different execution paths. Specifically, AFLNET [123] and Fieldfuzz [21] identify different
protocol states according to the status code in the response messages. Snipuzz [46] and FUME
[121] adopt the heuristic that different response messages mean different execution paths. Thus,
they keep the input that can cause a different response as a seed for subsequent mutation testing,
expecting to increase the coverage. Aafer et al. [3] and Logos [175] use the execution logs as a
feedback to refine the input generation grammars, as developers usually add log statements to
indicate the detailed information about input validation. Observing side channel information such
as system status, power consumption, and response time, Flowfuzz [151] determines whether
hardware switches have gone through different execution paths.

6 Bug Collector
To address the challenges in protocol fuzzing, existing work designs both memory-safety bug
oracles and non-memory safety bug oracles according to various information sources, as shown in
Fig. 7.

6.1 Memory-Safety Bug Oracles

Fatal Signals (Raised by Programs or Sanitizers). have been extensively utilized as a pivotal
6.1.1
mechanism for bug detection in a plethora of contemporary studies [15, 91, 92, 110, 125, 132, 138,

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.

153, 200]. Predominantly, memory-safety bugs manifest through the overwriting of data or code
pointers with invalid values, leading to critical process disruptions such as segmentation faults or
process terminations, thereby generating fatal signals like SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, and others. Fuzzers
can detect faults by checking whether the PUT process is dying from these signals. Addressing the
subset of memory-safety bugs that do not immediately precipitate program crashes, fuzzers employ
sanitizers. Sanitizers are bug detection tools that are specifically engineered to identify and highlight
unsafe or undesirable memory access patterns. Upon identification of such anomalies, sanitizers
are designed to terminate PUT, thus signaling the presence of a potential bug [143, 144, 154, 157].
Sanitizers can be enabled at compile-time[15, 91, 92, 110, 132, 138, 153, 200] or enabled dynamically
at runtime [96].

6.1.2 Crash Logs and Debug Information. Some works determine whether the PUTs are crashed
by analyzing system logs or debug information [21, 45, 53, 56, 120, 128, 174]. These system logs
and debug information can be obtained through various channels. Specifically, ICS3 Fuzzer uses
the Windows EventLog Service to detect crash events on Windows systems [45]. Swentooth [56]
and Braktooth [53] propose to collect startup messages or crash messages in the system logs using
the debug ports exposed by respective Bluetooth development boards. The startup message is an
indicator of program crashes, as Bluetooth devices have a watchdog program to reset the Bluetooth
SoC when finding it is unresponsive. Wang et al. [174] leverage NLP technology to process the
logs and detect unintended behavior of PUT. Unlike other sources, L2Fuzz [120] and FieldFuzz [21]
identify crashes by checking whether a crash dump was generated.

6.1.3 Error-Signaling Messages (labeled as “ESM” in Table 5 column 5). Many protocols use special
responses or status codes to indicate internal errors, and therefore can be used for bug detection. For
example, L2Fuzz detects Bluetooth L2CAP vulnerabilities by checking whether the received packet
contains an error signaling message such as Connection Failed, Connection Aborted, Connection
Reset, and Connection Refused [120]. These error messages indicate that the PUT may be crashed.
OWFuzz uses the Deauth / Disassoc frames, the management frames of the Wi-Fi protocol to
terminate the communication, as an indicator of anomaly during the fuzzing of the Wi-Fi protocol
stacks [23].

6.1.4 Abnormal Physical Behaviors (labeled as “APB” in Table 5 column 5). The abnormal physical
behavior of the target device, e.g., startup sound, can also be used as a bug oracle. For example,
when fuzzing the Bluetooth sound device, Braktooth uses the event of repeated startup sound as
a bug oracle [53]. This is because Bluetooth devices will be restarted by the watchdog program

when an error occurs, and a startup sound will be played during the booting process. Differently,
PCFuzzer [86] leverages an oscilloscope to collect the physical signal of the output module to
monitor the target’s status.

6.1.5 Timeout and Liveness Checks. Timeout and liveness checks identify crashes or infinite loops
by checking the target’s unresponsiveness. A common way to check the unresponsiveness of a
target is to set a static timeout for a response [23, 28, 46, 55, 57, 128, 156]. If the response message
from the target is not received by the time, it is determined that the target process is dead or enters
an infinite loop. This method is suitable for environments with limited debugging techniques,
such as unable to obtain process signals or debug logs. However, setting a fixed timeout is a
relatively coarse-grained method, which may introduce false positives due to network fluctuations
or excessive load on the target. Some works propose several active liveness checks to mitigate
the false positive issues. For example, Snipuzz [46] resends input sequences for multiple times to

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.

A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing

111:25

reduce false positives. IoTFuzzer [28], OWFuzz [23], and BadMesher [128] use heartbeat messages
(e.g., ICMP messages) to infer the status of the PUT.

6.2 Non-Memory-Safety Bug Oracles
Non-Memory-Safety bugs are bugs that are caused by non-memory access reasons and violate
some expected properties, such as logical bugs, RFC violations, or performance-influential bugs.
Non-Memory-Safety bugs are challenging to be identified because they have no uniform observable
behavior. Detecting non-memory-safety bugs usually requires the user to define the oracle according
to the properties destroyed by the target. Depending on the properties checked, these oracles
can be roughly divided into four categories, namely incorrect message content & state transitions,
inconsistency in transmission, abnormal performance indicators, and differences in execution. We will
describe these techniques in detail in the following subsections. It should be noted that although
there are various ways to identify possible non-memory-safety bugs, most of these methods can
only report suspicious behaviors of the PUT, which still require experts’ manual verification to
determine impact and exploitability.

Incorrect Message Content & State Transitions. Incorrect Message Content checks whether
6.2.1
the content of the responses violates some semantic constraints. Incorrect State Transitions verifies
whether the state transitions are valid or allowed. In most cases, these rules are extracted from
protocol specifications or designed with expert knowledge. These rules can be in different forms,
such as canonical state machines [18, 153], linear-temporal properties [103], constraints of response
messages [55, 56, 93], etc. For example, Beurdouche et al. [18] manually construct a standard state
machine from the specification and then use this state machine as a ground truth to identify deviant
behaviors of the PUT. Utilizing this method, a logical bug was identified in a TLS implementation
JSSE[18]. This flaw permitted attackers to bypass all messages pertaining to key exchange and
authentication, subsequently enabling them to initiate unencrypted communication.

Given a linear-time temporal logic property that a protocol implementation needs to satisfy,
LTL-Fuzzer [103] leverages directed greybox fuzzing to direct the fuzzing towards specific locations
that can affect the property and checks whether the property is held during each execution iteration.
In addition, Sweyntooth [56] and Greyhound [55] check whether the received response packet is
in the expected type set of the current protocol state. Any mismatched message types are labeled
anomaly. Loki [93] extracts rules from the PBFT consensus protocol paper [25], which are used
as oracles to detect non-memory-safety bugs in blockchain implementations. For example, Loki
identified a bug in Hyperledger Fabric [10] that can be used to confirm illegal transactions.

6.2.2 Message Inconsistency in Transmission. Some works check whether there are non-memory-
safety bugs that can lead to integrity break of the protocol. Specifically, since correct data transfer
is one of the basic properties of TCP protocol, TCP-Fuzz [200] designed a data checker on both the
sender and the receiver side to check the violation of this property. Whenever a message is sent or
received, the data checker checks if the sent message and the received message are identical.

6.2.3 Abnormal Performance Indicators. Some works aim to find network attack strategies that
can affect the performance of the PUT, and these works judge the effectiveness of attack strategies
by monitoring whether some performance indicators of PUT are beyond the normal range. For
example, to find the amplification DDoS attack strategies in UDP services, AMPFuzz [79] uses the
bandwidth amplification factor (BAF) [137] of each pair of requests and responses, which is the
ratio of the sum of the lengths of all response messages to the length of the attack request, as an
indicator to find the message that can maximize the consumption of throughput. TCPWN [69] and
ABBrate [122] aim to find attack strategies against implementations of TCP congestion control that

111:26

To be filled, et al.

can increase or decrease the congestion window in a model-guided approach. To detect whether
inputs indeed influence the congestion control mechanism, TCPWN obtains the window size from
system logs and compares it with an expected baseline.

6.2.4 Differences in Execution (labeled as “DE” in Table 5 column 6). Differential testing involves
comparing the execution behaviors of different implementations of the same protocol to investigate
potential security impacts. This method is scalable due to its independence from code instrumen-
tation. For example, TCP-Fuzz [200] compares the outputs of multiple TCP implementations to
identify discrepancies. Yang et al. [180] employ differential testing to uncover consensus bugs
in Ethereum that could lead to fork attacks. They generate a sequence of transactions as inputs
and observe the responses of two Ethereum clients, specifically implemented in Golang and Rust.
Similarly, IcyChecker [182] identifies blockchain state inconsistency bugs by generating mutated
DApp transaction sequences and verifying the consistency of the final states. ParDiff [195] uti-
lizes the bisimulation algorithm to compare the FSMs of different protocol implementations and
identifies discrepancies by analyzing the differences in state transition conditions. However, a sig-
nificant challenge in this domain is ascertaining which implementation diverges from the protocol’s
expected behavior, and determining whether observed behavioral differences stem from errors
or under-specifications in the protocol’s RFC. As such, most of the work that adopts differential
testing [20, 75, 180, 200] integrates a subsequent manual inspection phase to differentiate actual
vulnerabilities from innocuous discrepancies.

To augment the bug-finding efficiency, some studies compare the PUT with an already well-
tested or formally verified implementation, referred to as a ‘reference stack’ [200]. For example,
TCP-Fuzz [200] employs classical and extensively tested kernel-level TCP stacks, such as Linux
TCP or FreeBSD TCP, as a reference to test newer TCP stacks. In such scenarios, if inconsistencies
are reported, it strongly suggests the presence of bugs in the newer protocol implementations. This
methodology not only identifies discrepancies, but also provides a framework for evaluating the
correctness of various protocol implementations.

7 Directions of Future Research
So far, we have discussed state-of-the-art protocol fuzzers. In this section, we will address Survey
Dimension 3 by discussing the research trends and current challenges of fuzzing techniques based
on what we have surveyed.

7.1 Towards Perfect Communication Model Construction
The current methods for constructing communication models are far from perfect, often resulting in
incomplete or inaccurate knowledge acquisition, or requiring extensive manual effort. Specifically,
as introduced in Section 4, existing methodologies for constructing communication models can be
broadly categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches. Bottom-up methods are proposed
to learn communication models specific to particular protocol implementations [15, 39, 45, 47,
91, 102, 110, 123, 127, 173, 194], rather than the canonical communication model of the protocols
themselves. However, for top-down approaches, most existing works still rely heavily on manual
processes to construct state machines from protocol specifications [18, 55, 56, 63, 69, 70, 78, 120,
122, 136, 138, 149, 153, 200]. This manual construction is not only labor intensive, but is also prone
to errors.

Existing research [71, 118] has begun to explore the automatic extraction of partial FSMs from
protocol specifications using NLP techniques. This exploration has preliminarily validated the
feasibility of automating the extraction of protocol communication models. However, this method
currently falls short of extracting canonical communication models from protocol specifications due

ACM Comput. Surv., Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 111. Publication date: August 2018.

A Survey of Protocol Fuzzing

111:27

to ambiguities and unspecified behaviors in specifications, thus precluding a complete one-to-one
translation between the text and the communication model.

To resolve this, machine learning model-based approaches can be explored for better model
construction. Considering the recent remarkable progress of LLM (Large Language Model) [75,
111, 172, 192], one promising direction is to develop LLM-based solutions for more precise model
construction. Another possible direction is to combine the other information sources (such as the
code of protocol implementations, code commit or comment information during development,
program analysis results, etc.) to help better understand the content of the specification.

7.2 Towards Multi-Dimension Testing Perspectives
Existing research focuses more on changing the content of packets or the order of packet se-
quences. This approach, while effective to some extent, overlooked the fact that protocols have
multidimensional testing perspectives, e.g., variables such as message latency [68], cache state [73],
configurations [37, 193], and concurrency level [76], as highlighted in Section 3.1. These attributes
play a crucial role in deciding the behavior of the target system. To effectively test these attributes
within protocol implementations, it is necessary to create detailed models that accurately represent
each attribute, including message latency, cache state, configuration parameters, and concurrency
levels. Additionally, specific oracles and mutators can be designed to assess the correctness of
the protocol behavior in various scenarios that encompass these multidimensional aspects. This
direction is interesting and can help establish a more comprehensive evaluation of the protocol’s
resilience and robustness.

7.3 Fuzzing Characterized Protocol Targets
A significant and underexplored future research direction is the fuzzing of characterized protocol
targets. Current research has not fully covered various protocols, especially for those with distinct
characteristics and importance. The following three areas are particularly noteworthy:

1. Domain-Specific Protocols. Proprietary domain protocols, such as those used in satellite
communication [164], unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication [61], and Robot Operating
System (ROS) [114], typically possess a high knowledge threshold and a relatively closed nature.
These protocols play a crucial role in many infrastructures, making their security research para-
mount. Presently, fuzzing research for these protocols is relatively scarce, presenting an opportunity
for the academic community to improve testing effectiveness and security through the development
of new fuzzing techniques and tools.

2. Hardware-Implemented Protocols. Another direction is to design fuzzers for testing
protocols implemented on hardware such as FPGAs [167]. These hardware implementations often
exhibit different error characteristics compared to those at the software level, necessitating the
development of new approaches to more effectively identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities.
3. Multi-Party Protocols. Another possible direction of protocol fuzzing is to support multi-
party protocols. In general, protocols have many communication modes, such as peer-to-peer mode
[69, 122, 170], server-client (master-slave) mode [28, 45, 169], and multi-party mode [159]. Existing
protocol fuzzers focus more on the first two modes by acting as a client/server to test the other
[28, 45, 169], or playing a role as a peer node to test the PUT [69, 122, 170]. The multi-party protocols
have not been studied. For example, a node can play the role of a computing node, consensus node,
or management node in a blockchain network [10], each of which is responsible for a different task.
The correct execution of a smart contract protocol requires the cooperation of these roles. How to
efficiently test these multi-party protocols is an interesting but challenging question.

7.4 Combining with Other Vulnerability-Finding Techniques
Beyond fuzzing, there exists a wide range of vulnerability-finding techniques, such as symbolic
execution [11, 27, 140, 155, 160, 161] and model checking [26, 59, 65, 74, 108]. Although the com-
bination of these techniques with fuzzing has been explored in general contexts [158, 187], their
applications in protocol fuzzing remain relatively underexplored [155]. This presents a promising
future research direction, especially considering the fact that combined approaches still face unique
testing challenges for complex communications defined in protocols. Intuitively, future research
can improve existing vulnerability-finding techniques to better solve protocol-specific challenges.
In addition, many protocols are accompanied by high-quality learning sources, such as detailed
specifications. Future research can explore ways to utilize these valuable sources effectively to
inform and enhance combined approaches.

7.5 Shift-Left Protocol Fuzzing
Although there are certain research efforts focusing on the integration of general-purpose fuzzing
techniques into the development cycle – such as with tools like libFuzzer, OSS-Fuzz, and research
into fuzzing within CI/CD integration testing [130] – few studies have specifically dedicated them-
selves to bridging the gaps between protocol fuzzing and the development process. Protocol fuzzing
is distinct from general software fuzzing; it involves rigorously testing the various protocols that
allow for communication and data exchange between different software systems and components.
Protocol targets generally have a more complex development workflow than general software
targets. This complexity arises from their need to precisely follow set standards and specifications
to ensure interoperability across diverse systems, leading to unique challenges in integration and
testing. These challenges necessitate a tailored approach to fuzzing that understands and adapts
to the intricacies of protocol development. Therefore, a shift-left approach to protocol fuzzing is
needed, which would integrate protocol-specific fuzzing techniques earlier in the software devel-
opment lifecycle. This can involve the exploration of designing techniques from the developer’s
perspective, and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) [24] techniques can also be considered if
necessary. By doing so, it can surface vulnerabilities and issues at an earlier stage where they can be
addressed more easily and cost-effectively, ensuring a more robust and secure software ecosystem
for protocol implementations.
